business,us oil prices slip below 50 a barr,"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday�s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There�s serious concern the bottom�s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who�s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody�s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq�s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don�t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

Punjab will get a subsidy of Rs55 per metric ton for export while for Sindh this subsidy would be Rs45 per metric ton.Taking notice of unhindered import of wheat byproducts, the ECC also issued instructions for immediate ban on their import.The ECC considered a proposal moved by the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) and approved the provision of 30,000 tons of wheat to the United Nations World Food Programme for distribution among Temporarily Displaced Persons (TDPs), catering for the period up to March 2015.The ECC also observed that in case of further requirements, Safron could revert to the forum with a fresh proposal.The ECC considered and approved a proposal by the Water and Power Minstry to attract private sector investment in transmission line projects with the inclusion of upfront tariff as an option. The ECC also accorded approval for the extension of GSA between OGDCL and Fauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited (FKPCL) for provision of 20 mmcfd of gas at the earliest but not later than February 1.

business,new saudi king seen holding line on opec policy to keep oil output hig,"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

business,pakistan fuel crisis weighing on credit worthiness moody,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody�s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody�s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody�s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country�s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody�s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government�s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan�s import bill, it added.

In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It�s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate.

Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didn�t see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world�s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""It�s too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. ""I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.""Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world�s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

business,sbp warns islamic banks to be more equitab,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country�s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector�s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry�s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion�s share of financing by the country�s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.

It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

He added that prices could ""fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10"" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributor�s 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March advanced $1 to $52.69 a barrel compared with Friday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for March won 63 cents to stand at $58.43 a barrel in London afternoon trade.Last week saw WTI surge seven percent and Brent add 9.4 percent, their best weekly gains since February 2011.Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said the gains were ""motivated by supply-side influences"" in the United States.A survey by US oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc released Friday showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 to 1,140 in the week to February 6. The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world�s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

business,hsbc admits swiss bank failings over client tax,"LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.""We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,"" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain�s The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw �bricks� of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.

However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the world�s third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.

business,fbr moves to widen tax net but big fish yet to be caug,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest � and most influential � to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif�s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year � barely enough to cover just the country�s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught � several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR�s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.�War on tax cheats�""FBR is after those who can�t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan�s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country�s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan�s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent � but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government�s reform programme � tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender � was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government�s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

It later stood at $42.70, down $1.18 from Monday�s close.Nearing midday in London, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for May delivery fell $1.14 to $52.80 a barrel.Crude futures also dropped Monday on worries over growing US oil inventories, which already stand at record-high levels adding to the global oversupply.In addition, the market fell sharply after OPEC questioned the strength of last month�s rally, saying in a report that the price increase came ""despite the fact that global supply continued to exceed demand"".Traders are now eagerly awaiting Wednesday�s weekly US government report on crude reserves for the week to March 13.""Growing concerns that US crude stockpiles would see additional builds this week pushed prices lower,"" said Sucden analyst Kash Kamal.A Bloomberg News survey showed US crude stockpiles are expected to have increased by 3.3 million barrels to 452.2 million last week.US crude stockpiles have risen for nine weeks in a row to reach a record 448.9 million barrels on March 6.Singapore�s United Overseas Bank said the recent price decline was due to ""concerns that US crude supplies are at record levels and continue to build up"".World oil prices have collapsed by more than half since June last year on mounting US supplies, weak global economic growth and OPEC�s decision to keep output high despite falling prices.Leading US energy producers have curtailed some investment, resulting in lower weekly rig counts.Despite the reduced drilling, Goldman Sachs estimated Monday that US output would still grow by 230,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a year ago.

The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen, down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.""It�s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates �lift-off� will begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)"" meeting, National Australia Bank said.""The key takeaway is that (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market�s mind the data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.""After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain ""patient"" on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. ""Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn�t mean we�re going to be impatient,"" Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed�s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen�s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank�s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.""The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,"" he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.

business,oil drops as saudi output nears record china demand worries drag,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices dropped on Tuesday after activity in China's factory sector fell to an 11-month low and as Saudi Arabia said its production was close to an all-time high.The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis, stoking worries over the strength of the world's No.2 economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.6.""Considering that the preliminary PMI figures for major crude importers turned out much lower than estimates ... we expect both WTI and Brent to end-off today lower,"" Singapore-based Phillip Futures said on Tuesday.The PMI drop in China followed an overnight report that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, was now pumping around 10 million barrels of crude oil per day, a near all-time high and some 350,000 bpd above the figure Saudi Arabia gave to OPEC for its February output.""The market was under pressure early in the trading day after comments from Saudi Arabia that it was producing almost 10 million barrels per day,"" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Brent crude oil futures were trading down 47 cents at $55.45 a barrel at 0750 GMT.

The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group � the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany � hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world�s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member�s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.

business,oil up more than 1 after saudis asia price hi,"SINGAPORE: Oil futures climbed more than $1 a barrel on Monday, after Saudi Arabia raised prices for crude sales to Asia for a second month, signalling better demand in the region.International benchmark Brent regained ground after tumbling as much as 5 percent on Thursday, when a preliminary nuclear deal was finally reached between world powers and Iran. More Iranian oil could enter global markets if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.""While clearly a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number of obstacles,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.""Even if a final deal is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,"" the analysts said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21 higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working, although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai quotes, analysts said.""There is still competition for the Asia market even though it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete in the market right now,"" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in May dropped 64 cents to $51.50 a barrel compared with Monday�s close. Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts had surged by three dollars each on Monday.""The current decline in oil prices is most likely due to profit-taking,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.""Most traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as sanctions get lifted,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. ""However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions would only be lifted slowly,"" he added.Iran has the world�s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.

business,asian shares rise hong kong at seven year hig,"Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied Wednesday, led by an almost four percent surge in Hong Kong on its first post-holiday trading day as it reacted to weak US jobs data that reduced the chances of a rate rise any time soon.The Japanese central bank�s decision to delay any new easing measures pushed the yen up against the dollar, while investors await the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve�s latest policy meeting.Oil prices ticked lower on profit-taking in Asia after climbing Tuesday to their highest level of 2015.Hong Kong, which last traded on Thursday, soared 3.80 percent, or 961.22 points, to 26,236.86.Shanghai ended 0.84 percent, or 33.43 points higher at 3,994.81 and Tokyo added 0.76 percent, or 149.27 points, to 19,789.81.Sydney rose 0.59 percent, or 34.7 points, to 5,960.7 and Seoul advanced 0.60 percent, or 12.23 points, to end at 2,059.26.Last week�s Labor Department data showing that the US economy created fewer jobs in March than it had for more than a year raised expectations that rates will be kept low through the summer.The next focal point is the release later Wednesday of minutes from the last Fed meeting, with dealers poring over them for clues about when the bank plans to announce a rise.In currency trading the dollar edged down after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy even though the country is struggling to overcome anaemic price growth.The dollar bought 119.88 yen, down from 120.32 yen in New York Tuesday but well above the low-119 yen range seen in Tokyo at the start of the week soon after the US jobs data.- Greece fears linger -""There�s still a little bit of doubt in the market as to really where the US economy is, and more importantly, how the Fed perceives the US economy,"" Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand, told Bloomberg News. The dollar is ""in a little bit of a holding pattern"", he added.The euro rose to $1.0875 in Tokyo from $1.0813 in New York and to 130.32 yen from 130.11 yen.However, dealers were cautious as Greece faces a Thursday deadline for its next bailout repayment to the International Monetary Fund. Eurozone deputy finance ministers will meet on Wednesday and Thursday to seek agreement on Athens�s reforms needed to unlock the last tranche of its multibillion-dollar bailout and avert a default.On Wall Street Tuesday the Dow edged down 0.03 percent, the S&P 500 dropped 0.21 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.14 percent.Oil prices retreated from their 2015 highs, which were prompted by an easing of fears that Iranian crude would soon flood the market after last week�s nuclear deal with the West. Also providing support was news that Saudi Arabia had raised prices for Asia, citing increased demand.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery fell $1.10 to $52.88 a barrel in afternoon Asian trade and Brent crude for May dropped 71 cents to $58.39.On Tuesday WTI rose $1.84 and Brent was up 98 cents.Gold fetched $1,211.01 against $1,212.72 late Tuesday.In other markets:-- Taipei fell 0.73 percent, or 69.93 points, to 9,571.97.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. sank 2.05 percent to Tw$143.0 while Hon Hai eased 0.11 percent to Tw$93.7.-- Wellington was flat, edging up 4.28 points to 5,859.71.Spark New Zealand sank 2.77 percent to NZ$2.98 while Air New Zealand added 1.29 percent to NZ$2.75.-- Manila closed 0.77 percent lower, giving up 60.72 points to 8,037.96.Ayala Land was unchanged at 40 pesos while BDO Unibank Inc. dropped 1.17 percent to 118.50 pesos and Metro Pacific Investments fell 4.13 percent to 4.64 pesos.

business,asia shares mostly up china data disappoi,"Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent, but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world�s number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors� expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong�s market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong�s Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai�s exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE�s announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months. That came at the end of a week that also saw major mergers including Royal Dutch Shell and FedEx.The Dow climbed 0.55 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.52 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.43 percent.On currency markets the dollar was at 120.31 yen, compared with 120.30 yen in New York.The euro bought $1.0590 and 127.41 yen against $1.0599 and 127.50 yen.Oil prices edged higher.

business,lending to private sector falls 36pc in july apri,"KARACHI: Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central bank�s efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed on Tuesday.Analyst said banks� hefty invested into the government papers and low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9 billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of banks� higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through the opening market operations.Tuesday�s data on monetary aggregates depicted that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230 trillion from a same period a year ago.The government�s rising demand for bank borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts� view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, �Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.�Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the legal framework for creditors� rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and impaired access to finance.

""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn�t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand.

The move took effect Monday.""While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy than official comments previously indicated,"" said Brian Jackson, China economist at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action, prices retraced some gains after Saudi Arabia�s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast for US inventories.""It�s been choppy,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors, he said, are ""trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn"" in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape, showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.""There may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from the economies of the US, eurozone and China,"" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics.

West Texas Intermediate for May delivery sank $1.12, or two percent, to close at $55.26 a barrel on its last day the contract�s trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, settled at $62.08 a barrel in London trade, down $1.37 (2.2 percent) from Monday�s closing level.News of the Saudi-led coalition wrapping up air strikes against rebels in Yemen, coming in afternoon trade in New York, accelerated losses on the market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group.""Oil is selling because the Saudis are going to end their operation in Yemen,"" Flynn said. ""This is why we�ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.""The end of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition saying the rebels� threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed, eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday�s weekly inventories report from the US Department of Energy were bearish. The country�s historically high crude inventories were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve. News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.""There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note Tuesday. ""Due to sharply higher OPEC oil production, the market remains significantly oversupplied."" (AFP)

business,hopes and fears as milan expo opens door,"MILAN: Milan�s Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italy�s deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since Shanghai�s groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city�s renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milan�s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the country�s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with Italy�s unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to Italy�s strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movement�s march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of Friday�s demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expo�s critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.

business,oil prices firm after strong apri,"London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

business,gulf oil exporters should cut spending diversify imf,"DUBAI: Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They would be better off to ""adjust gradually"" using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.

Abdullah al-Attiyah, who led the energy portfolio in oil-rich Qatar for about two decades, said Monday that OPEC should first reach a binding agreement with non-members before reducing production.""OPEC should not do anything because it is not the swing producer"" of the past, Attiyah told reporters in Kuwait City.""They cannot and will not cut (output) unless the main producers outside OPEC join forces,"" he said.The 12-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in November maintained output levels despite tumbling prices. The group, led by de-facto kingpin Saudi Arabia, pumps about 30 percent of global crude.Nicholas Teo, analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, added that concerns over a persistent global oversupply ""continue to put a cap on oil prices"". Those worries were compounded by the latest US data showing petroleum drilling is picking up in some areas. The closely watched Baker Hughes US oil rig count fell by just 11 to 668 last week.Dealers have been hoping that a slowdown in US shale output could help ease the build up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January. Overall crude reserves in the United States likely fell by 500,000 barrels in the week to May 8, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.

business,us oil production important amid clean energy transition ob,"WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama Thursday called US oil production an �important� source of energy as America transitions towards cleaner resources, defending his move to allow petroleum giant Shell to drill in the Alaskan Arctic.Obama�s administration gave the petroleum giant a green light three days ago to explore the Chukchi Sea near Alaska -- as long as the Anglo-Dutch firm has the correct permits from the agencies that regulate the environment and marine mammal health.Environmental groups oppose the drilling due to the vulnerability of Arctic animals that are already struggling with melting sea ice and the risk that an oil spill would pose to the region.""Despite the fact that Shell had put in an application for exploration in this region several years ago, we delayed it for a very lengthy period of time, until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances that we have not seen before,"" Obama said during a Thursday press conference.Shell put its drilling plans for the Alaska Arctic on hold in 2013 following multiple embarrassing problems with its two rigs.One, the Kulluk, washed ashore after breaking loose from towing vessels in stormy seas in southern Alaska in January.Another, the Noble Discoverer, was recently cited by the US Coast Guard for numerous safety and operational deficiencies.Both rigs were sent to Asia for repair and maintenance work.""Shell had to go back to the drawing board, revamp its approach,"" Obama said.""I am working internationally to reduce our carbon emissions and to replace, over time, fossil fuels with clean energies,"" he added.""In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil fuels, and when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil and natural gas is important,"" Obama said.He added that importing oil and gas meant it might be ""purchased from places that have much lower environmental standards than we do.""Some Americans grew increasingly wary of drilling after the April 2010 explosion of BP-leased Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean.A Shell spokesman said that operations in the Chukchi Sea are scheduled to begin in the coming months.

business,china pm on brazil visit promising big inv,"BRASILIA: Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang headed to Brazil on Monday on a three-day visit with a promise of $50 billion in investment for creaking infrastructure as his hosts finalize preparations for next year�s Rio Olympics.Li, who was due to land late afternoon in the capital Brasilia, will hold talks Tuesday with President Dilma Rousseff, for whom the investment will be a major boon. Brazil�s economy is battling a fifth straight year of poor growth and spiraling inflation. Li will head for Rio on Tuesday evening to see some of China�s investment in the city, which Brasilia supplanted as the capital in 1960 but which will in August next year welcome South America�s first ever Olympic Games.On Thursday, Li will continue a Latin American swing designed to increase Chinese influence in the region, heading to Colombia before visiting Peru and Chile.Chinese investment in Brazil has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil�s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole rose some 2,550 percent between 2000 and 2012 from barely $10 billion to $255.5 billion.Boom in Sino-Brazilian tradeSino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, said ahead of Li�s arrival that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is under way. The first involved trade in raw materials and the focus now is on heavy industry and infrastructure, he said.Graca Lima said Friday that Rousseff and Li will ink a series of accords on political and commercial issues, and some 30 investment deals. One mooted project is a proposed rail link stretching some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) from the key Brazilian port of Santos to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.Graca Lima said the plan would take some three to four years to realize, but he assured it is ""advancing,"" despite some environmental groups voicing concern.The countries are also expected to announce the delivery of 22 jetliners from Brazil�s Embraer to China -- part of a larger order of 60 airplanes from the world�s number three commercial aircraft developer.Brazil has seen its reputation hit by a huge graft scandal at oil giant Petrobras. But the firm received a boost earlier this year when it signed a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.""China is fulfilling a desperately-needed role of investor in Latin America and the Caribbean -- Brazil desperately needs investment,"" says Charles Tang, chairman of the Rio-based Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry.""The US back yard is growing a Chinese back garden - not just in Brazil but all over Latin America.""""We believe in the fundamentals of Brazil,"" Tang told AFP.""China sees opportunities in Brazil for investment and also has the funds available to invest"" for strategic and geopolitical reasons.In an interview, Tang referred to a World Policy Institute essay he penned in 2013 in which he said ""Latin America and China�s economies are complementary. Brazil ... has insufficient savings to finance increases in export production and job creation or build the infrastructure it needs.""China has abundant capital -- but needs the plentiful strategic resources that Brazil has.""Li�s visit will feature trade delegations some 130-strong from both countries during his Brasilia stay. In Rio, he will attend the unveiling of Chinese-made trains for a new Metro line.

Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,"" said analysts at Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said ""global oversupply with weak demand"" continues to put a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already ""used to"" unrest in the region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez Canal.""Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,"" Commerzbank analysts added. ""In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.""Oil supplies from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers, which have higher costs, out of the market.

business,senate passes gas infrastructure development cess bill amid pr,"ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan� APP/Geo News

business,china brazil unveil multibillion trade investment d,"BRASILIA: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South America�s largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of Li�s first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Li�s host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the country�s tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South America�s first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Li�s first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for Brazil�s state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a ""new intensity in our relations.""""China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,"" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to China�s ""rich experience"" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing ""would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.""Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazil�s flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazil�s number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.Li�s tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to China�s Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazil�s Vale, the world�s biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil�s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Li�s arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that ""a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,"" Rousseff told reporters.

business,oil down after opec meeting eyes on iran ,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran�s nuclear programme.  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Iran�s nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the world�s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP)

business,gulf expat workers send home 100 billion repor,"KUWAIT CITY: Foreigners working in the energy-rich Arab states of the Gulf sent more than $100 billion in remittances to their home countries last year, an economic report showed Tuesday.The figure was twice as high as remittances in 2010, an indication of strong growth, the head of economic research at Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz), Raghu Mandagoathur, said in the report.Around 25 million expats live in the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- equal to the native population.The remittances are estimated at 6.2 percent of the combined GDP of the six GCC states of $1.6 trillion, the report said, citing IMF and World Bank figures.In comparison, foreigners in the United States and Britain sent home just 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP, respectively, it said.Saudi Arabia topped the list with its estimated 10 million expats sending home $44 billion, followed by UAE with 29 billion.Remittances from Kuwait and Qatar were $12 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, while smaller transfers were made out of Oman and Bahrain, the report said.The majority of Gulf expatriates originate from India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen.The report attributed the high level of remittances to curbs applied by GCC states on foreign ownership and investment.And unlike in Western countries, foreigners have no hope of acquiring citizenship in GCC states regardless of the duration of residence.The report advised GCC states to encourage expatriates to invest by launching specialised services and opening up their markets to foreign residents, especially the real estate sector.

A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moody�s said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund.

business,china stock market freezing up as sell off gathers ,"SHANGHAI: China's tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of ""panic sentiment"" gripping investors.Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell-off, and the People's Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares.The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 6.8 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 5.9 percent.With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a buyer, blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the week bore the brunt.""I've never seen this kind of slump before. I don't think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,"" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities.""Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.""More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece.""Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note. ""We expect slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis.""Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world's second largest economy, with copper prices falling to a six-year low, Shanghai nickel futures sliding by their 5 percent daily limit, and oil falling towards $56 a barrel, near a three month-low.TRADING HALTSMore than 500 China-listed firms announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking total suspensions to about 1,300 - 45 percent of the market or roughly $2.4 trillion worth of stock - as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage.With so many small-cap companies sheltering on the sidelines, the ChiNext growth board, which has seen some of the biggest swings in valuations, fell a modest 0.8 percent.The plunge in China's previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China's top leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.Beijing's interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars' worth of stocks, helped by a state-backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided 260 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) to 21 brokerages, though that sum is only 40 percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since June 18.RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets, which are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around 85 percent of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.""It's uncommon to see so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls, and the index futures swinging so wildly,"" said Wang Feng, CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.""It's a stampede. And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.""A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other ""stability measures"" have done little to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there had been a big increase in ""irrational selling"" of stocks.Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.""Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in their share prices,"" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie.

business,imf lowers 2015 global growth forecast to 3.3%,"Washington: The International Monetary Fund lowered its 2015 global economic growth forecast on Thursday, citing a likely ""temporary setback"" from the United States in the first months of the year.The IMF also highlighted the risk of ""financial stress"" in Europe from the Greek debt crisis and China�s slowdown, but left forecasts for the eurozone and the Asian giant unchanged.The Washington-based institution projected the world economy would grow 3.3 percent this year, less than the 3.5 percent pace it had forecast in April and slightly slower than 2014. The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.""Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,"" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF�s chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.""The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lion�s share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,"" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the world�s largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. Canada�s forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and Mexico�s by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economy�s soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness ""now that the fog has largely cleared.""""Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,"" he said.Greece�s debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).""Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,"" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed ""broadly on track"".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. ""Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,"" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.""The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,"" Blanchard said.""There is no particular reason to have lost confidence"" in China�s economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the world�s number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin America�s largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.""The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,"" it said.

The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China�s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China�s economy, the world�s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China�s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran�s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity.

""So it�s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.""""Now that it�s actually happened, people are buying back in,"" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran�s oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.""To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran�s stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Iran�s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran�s nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC�s fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.""Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,"" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.""Iran�s oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,"" it noted.The ratings agency added: ""We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.""The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.""A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is ""interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran�s energy potential"".BP added in a statement: ""We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities once able to do so.""Lid on pricesLooking ahead, ""the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market"", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.""We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,"" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase.Iran�s OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq ""have both significantly ramped up production this year"", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.""There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,"" he told AFP.

business,inflation falls to decade low according to sbp report of july march fy15,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector, in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.�The first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15,� the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued, the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit, and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last year�s level, could not match the outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from a robust growth in workers� remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBP�s liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year ago, enough to finance three months of the country�s import bill.The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decade�s low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing sectors (agriculture and industry), services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year.

On Monday, gold tumbled to $1,072.35 in Asian deals, striking the lowest point since February 11, 2010, and breaching the key psychological barrier of $1,100, as the precious metal continued to be weighed down by a strong US dollar and reports of massive selling in China.The metal is traditionally regarded by many investors as a safe store of value in times of economic or geopolitical turmoil.

The fresh volatility comes after Beijing launched a series of initiatives to staunch a bloodletting that saw a 30 percent plunge in Shanghai and trillions wiped off valuations.Among the measures were a police crackdown on short-selling and a ban on big shareholders and company executives from selling stock for six months, adding to earlier announcements.Meanwhile, dealers said a drop in commodities prices raised concerns about the global economy as crude oil briefly fell below $50 a barrel on Tuesday, and gold traded near a five-year low.""This commodities rout is a very big concern,"" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg News. ""There�s risk for a further downside. It looks like the overall global growth outlook is continuing to slow.""Investors were also keeping an eye on Greece where the government hiked taxes and paid billions of euros to its creditors on Monday, as banks reopened just days after the debt-laden country reached a bailout deal with its creditors.In currency markets, the dollar was trading around a five-week high at 124.34 yen, against 124.30 yen in New York on Monday.The euro bought $1.0825 and 134.61 yen, little changed from $1.0824 and 134.55 yen in US trading.""The weaker yen and cheaper oil will have a positive effect on Japanese stocks,"" said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.Eyes are now on Washington as the Federal Reserve considers when to hike interest rates from their record lows as the US economy gets back up to speed.

business,gold slides towards 5 year ,"LONDON: Gold fell back towards five-year lows on Wednesday as investors continued to pull away from the precious metal, with a slide through key chart levels earlier this week setting prices up for further losses.A looming rise in US interest rates, the first in nearly a decade, has dented gold's investment appeal, encouraging more sellers in the market after Monday's 3 percent rout, its biggest one-day drop since September 2013.Holdings in top gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining another 4.8 tonnes to hit their lowest since 2008. Its reserves have nearly halved from their 2012 peak.Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,095.69 an ounce at 0940 GMT, while US gold futures for August delivery were down $8.70 an ounce at $1,094.80. On Monday, gold slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1,088.05 an ounce.It failed to benefit from a softer tone to the dollar and stock markets on Wednesday, which usually would be expected to give some respite to the metal.""We expect further losses in gold,"" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. ""Gold prices are falling against the weaker dollar, declining equity markets -- those are clearly bad signs. Everything speaks against rising gold prices.""ETF investors are getting rid of their holdings, and it seems speculators are also continuing to sell. It's a perfect storm for gold,"" he said. ""Expectations about the developments of US interest rates are clearly an underlying trend.""Monday's selloff came on the back of huge volumes traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange after investors dumped more than $500 million of bullion in New York in four seconds during early Asian trading hours.That sparked a slide through key chart levels, triggering stop-loss orders that added to momentum. From a technical perspective, gold remains under pressure.""Our next price target is seen at $1,044, the 2010 low, followed by $1,006, the late 2009 high,"" technical analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note. ""Lower lows and lower highs keep this bearish price move in motion. Only a close back above $1,133 will stabilize the metal.""Physical demand has been sluggish despite this week's steep price drop. India is not rushing to pick up slack Chinese demand as would-be buyers wait for further price drops, with a wedding season lull and poor rains curbing appetite.Spot platinum was down 0.9 percent at $968.95 an ounce, while palladium was down 1.1 percent at $618.90, both trading near multi-year lows.

business,microsoft rolls out windows 10 bid to revive gr,"WASHINGTON: Microsoft began rolling out its Windows 10 operating system Wednesday, aiming to revive the tech giant�s fortunes, especially in mobile and the ""Internet of Things.""The stakes are high for Microsoft as it pushes out the new operating system for both traditional computers and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.The US tech giant is hoping the new system can help it gain traction in mobile, where it lags behind Google Android and Apple iOS.""Our vision was one platform, one store, and one experience that extends across the broadest range of devices from the smallest screens to the largest screens to no screens at all,"" said Microsoft executive vice president for Windows Terry Myerson in a blog post.""Windows 10 begins to deliver on our vision for more personal computing. In this world experiences are mobile, moving with you seamlessly and easily across your devices. Interacting with technology is as natural as interacting with people -- using voice, pen, gestures and even gaze for the right interaction, in the right way, at the right time. And in our connected and transparent world, we respect your privacy and help protect your information.""Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett said Microsoft faces a tough task in catching up with Google and Apple in the mobile space.""Microsoft will face a long road ahead to gain Windows share in mobile,"" he said.""While it will win a growing share of enterprise tablet purchases, the plans for Windows 10 don�t show enough potential to create a differentiated mobile experience that will draw developers and customers away from iOS and Android.""Richard Edwards, analyst at the consultancy Ovum, said Microsoft is looking beyond mobile to emerging technologies including wearables and other connected devices.""This isn�t about recapturing the important mobile operating systems market,"" Edwards said.""It�s about gaining a strong foothold in the next multibillion dollar market: the �Internet of Things.�""- Skipping to Windows 10 -Windows 10 -- Microsoft skipped directly from Windows 8, which got a lackluster response -- is being offered as a free upgrade for most devices, making it possible to be available quickly on billions of devices.It will allow for voice, pen and gesture input, and in some cases biometric identification for improved security.The Cortana virtual assistant -- Microsoft�s answer to Apple�s Siri and Google Now -- will also be integrated.And Windows 10 will include the Microsoft Edge browser, a move designed to help the tech giant regain market share lost to rivals such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.Microsoft hopes to break the cycle in which consumers shun Windows for mobile because it lacks the large catalog of applications found on rival platforms, thus discouraging app makers from creating Windows versions.Hit apps could ramp up popularity of Windows-driven hardware made by Microsoft and its partners, and increase opportunities for the company to make money from online activities such as search, shopping and software as services in the Internet cloud.With Windows 10 and other products, Microsoft is shifting away from one-time software sales to a subscription model -- or software as a service -- in an effort to better compete in the new tech landscape.Bob O�Donnell at the research firm Technalysis said the new operating system may help stimulate new sales of computers and other hardware -- a phenomenon of the past which has been absent in recent Windows releases.""I�m still hopeful that the PC industry will see some decent upside from Windows 10, particularly in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2016,"" he said.""The primary reason for my optimism is that Microsoft has actually integrated quite a few new capabilities into Windows 10 that will benefit from new hardware.""

business,pakistans japanese dominated car market poised for new entr,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented � thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the country�s sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore � yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while ""Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan"".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest. ""There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants in Pakistan,"" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European cars dominated Pakistan�s roads in the early years after it gained independence from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the 1990s, while South Korea�s Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried � and failed � to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900 in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan�s roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan�s booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachi�s share market among the world�s top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.""Pakistani automakers haven�t really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,"" Khan told AFP.""But given VW�s impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.""

The dollar index rose to its highest since April against a basket of major currencies.Gold may languish below $1,100 as investors wait out Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls, said MKS Group dealer Samuel Laughlin.Bullion could test $1,080 on Wednesday, he said, following Lockhart's comments although some Chinese demand where onshore premium is around $2 an ounce over the global benchmark is providing some support.Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped further on Tuesday to 21.56 million ounces, the lowest since September 2008.Spot platinum and palladium wallowed near multi-year lows on a global glut and weak demand from the automotive sector.Platinum was unchanged at $951.60 an ounce, after sinking to $940.50 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2009.

It puts us in a unique position among global news providers,"" said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of the New York Times Company.""We believe that no other news organisation has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or comparable digital subscription revenue. It�s a tribute to the hard work and innovation of our marketing, product and technology teams and the continued excellence of our journalism.""The Times began its online paywall strategy in 2011 and has been emphasising digital as print circulation and advertising decline.In 2012, the company said it took in more revenue from circulation than advertising for the first time.Thompson said international customers represent about 13 percent of the digital subscribers, noting that it was ""a percentage we expect will continue to grow very nicely in the coming quarters.""Digital traffic was up 27 percent year-over-year, to an average of 60 million monthly users, which helps boost ad revenues, according to Thomson.Ken Doctor, a media analyst at Outsell, said the milestone for the newspaper is ""worth celebrating for all who value journalism.""But Doctor said the newspaper cannot rest on its laurels.""The next generation of Times execs faces this question: What do we build on top of the paywall?"" he said in a blog post.This model ""can only take the Times so far; it needs to find additional spigots of reader revenue to get past flat revenue and into growth.""- Quarterly numbers -The Times said separately that its profit for the second quarter jumped 79 percent from a year ago to $16.4 million.The rise in profit came amid lower costs, while revenues dipped 1.5 percent from a year earlier, to $382 million.Circulation revenues grew, but failed to make up for the drop in advertising revenues.Second-quarter print advertising revenue fell 12.8 percent while digital ad sales grew 14.2 percent. Digital advertising pulled in $48.3 million, or 32.5 percent, of total ad revenues for the quarter ending June 30.Digital ad growth ""was again driven by growth in mobile, paid posts and video,"" Thompson said.""Expense management will remain a top priority as we head into the second half of 2015, although our emphasis on digital investment and execution is also more intense than ever.""Thompson said he expects to boost readership through partnerships recently announced with Facebook and Starbucks.

The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded 422 vehicles.

business,china weakens yuan amid economic and reform b,"Shanghai: China�s central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the world�s second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan -- also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the country�s exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in the US.The People�s Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen the yuan�s two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range is calculated from a central ""reference rate"" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC�s move means it will now also take into account the previous day�s close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency�s value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before Tuesday�s announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.

business,fbr makes e filing must for salaried per,"KARACHI: In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015. Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. �In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,� he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. �It will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time,� he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBR�s new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers� data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.

business,asian shares mixed in muted trade after wall st rally,"Hong Kong: Asian shares were mixed Thursday, as an afternoon rally on Wall Street gave investors room to breathe after concerns about China�s economy jolted global financial markets.The dollar inched higher, after taking a knock in New York from speculation the US Federal Reserve will delay hiking interest rates following China�s devaluation of the yuan.Tokyo opened flat, easing 0.23 points, Sydney added 0.57 percent and Seoul dipped 0.1 percent after the South Korean central bank left its key rate at a record low.Hong Kong added 0.60 percent and Shanghai rose 0.19 percent in early deals.China cut the rate of the yuan against the dollar for the third consecutive day Thursday, reducing the reference rate by 1.1 percent from the previous session.The reduction comes after two previous cuts, on Tuesday and Wednesday, sparked concerns that China�s economy, long an engine for world growth, is weaker than previously thought.The move fanned fears the Chinese currency could be set for a prolonged depreciation and send shockwaves reverberating through global financial markets.Commodities along with stocks in Europe and Asia fell, safe-havens gold and bonds rose and currencies in Asia-Pacific suffered their worst two-day selloff since 1998.But an afternoon comeback on Wall Street, led by Apple and energy stocks, and news China�s central bank had intervened to stop the yuan tanking on Wednesday cheered dealers.The intervention ""is a hopeful sign that the authorities are not shooting for a maxi-devaluation,"" Tim Condon, head of Asian research at ING in Singapore, told Bloomberg News.In Tokyo forex trade, the dollar fetched 124.30 yen early Thursday against 124.24 yen in New York late Wednesday.The euro exchanged hands at $1.1156 and 138.67 yen compared with $1.1159 and 138.63 yen in US trade.Oil prices were mixed on Thursday after edging up from a six-year low in New York on news US oil supplies declined and the dollar retreated.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September fell three cents to $43.27 and Brent crude for September rose five cents to $49.71 in morning Asian trade.Safe-haven gold fetched $1,121.23 compared to $1,117.50 late Wednesday.In individual shares, Australia�s Telstra fell two percent to Aus$6.12 after the telecoms company said annual net profit fell one percent Aus$4.23 billion after the sale of Hong Kong mobile business CSL.Chinese Internet giant Alibaba closed more than five percent lower in New York at $73.38 after a disappointing quarterly report showed sales growth cooling.

business,oil prices slide further in asi,"Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Monday as a global glut of crude supplies showed no signs of abating in the face of sluggish demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery fell 63 cents to $41.87 a barrel in late-morning trade, the lowest since March 2009. Brent crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brent�s September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling prices.""The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to pressure oil prices,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of an imminent US rate rise, after China�s shock devaluation of the yuan last week hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.""The devaluation of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.""This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.""Gupta said traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for further clues on the health of the world�s second-largest economy.Traders will also comb through the minutes of the US central bank�s meeting in late July, due for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.""We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few months,"" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.

business,buzzfeed gets 200m expansion cash with nbcuniversal tie u,"WASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and ""shareable"" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for ""strategic partnerships"" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the ""social news"" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.""It�s a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,"" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed�s founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.""BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,"" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.""They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.""The investment follows Monday�s announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat ""shareable"" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by France�s Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeed�s finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed ""has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.""BuzzFeed ""is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,"" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often don�t read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in ""native"" advertising, which includes ""sponsored"" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed�s executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean ""collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.""Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of ""unicorns,"" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU. And Vice Media last year secured some $500 million which boosted its valuation to a reported $2.5 billion.One of the largest digital-only news groups is the Huffington Post, whose future is uncertain after its parent company AOL was sold this year to telecom giant Verizon.

business,oil prices fall ahead of us stocks d,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the world�s top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the world�s biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world�s top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.

It later stood at $40.30, down 50 cents from Wednesday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for October delivery meanwhile slid to $46.31 a barrel, a point last seen in mid-January and not far off a six-year nadir. The contract later stood at $46.40, down 76 cents.""US stockpiles unexpectedly expanded when the market was looking at a contraction, which heightened the global oversupply concerns,"" said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG Markets.""This added pressure to crude prices, and we see WTI drop below $41, heading towards the key $40 level. We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions remain unfavourable to oil.""The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32 a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured by excess supplies.""Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015 begging the question how low can oil go,"" it said in a market commentary, adding that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel ""is a conceivable reality.""But Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in Thursday�s trading session.""Technically, we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below $40 is going to be an arduous task,"" he said.""We see $40 for WTI to be a strong psychological support.""

business,fbr initiates drive to ensure tax return filing by vehicle owner,"KARACHI: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated a drive to identify income sources of luxurious vehicles� owners to ensure their tax return filings, confiscating vehicles on non-compliance, official sources said on Thursday.The sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department.�We are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities,� said a source.The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used, especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.�The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income,� said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles.�Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy,� the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest.�Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs,� the report said.Besides, many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.�It will be difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario,� said a source in the Inland Revenue.

It was quoted 103.50/103.70 against the greenback.The rupee also breached its support level of 101 and closed at 102.02 versus dollar in the interbank market.The rupee has depreciated 3.5 percent since August 2014. The [interest] spread on buying and selling of the dollar between interbank and open markets has widened to Rs2. The State Bank has clearly instructed that the spread should not exceed 25 paisas.Malik Bostan, President Forex Association of Pakistan said the open currency market was volatile due to rise in dollar demand from Hajj pilgrims and imposition of 0.3 percent withholding tax on banking transactions for non-filers, who are now trading in dollar to avoid the tax.Hajj flights started from August 17 and will end next month. Therefore, Bostan said people have started buying dollar and Saudi Riyal for their journey.Meanwhile, the head of the central bank�s foreign exchange department, in a meeting with the representatives of exchange companies, directed them to bring stability in the kerb market by ensuring smooth supply of the foreign currencies.Bostan said the SBP ordered the exchange companies, during the meeting, to use biometric verification system in foreign exchange dealings for due diligence of the customer.�The SBP said it would provide foreign exchange to the exchange companies to curb the shortage,� Bostan claimed.�It was also suggested that companies would not sell or buy single dollar without providing the CNIC (computerised national identity card) from the customer.�

These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,"" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of ""millennials,"" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.""Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,"" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch family�s 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.""It�s as much a hedge as anything else,"" Doctor said.""It�s a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.""Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, ""you can see the fault lines,"" Doctor said. ""Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.""The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.""BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,"" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means ""using data science to understand how information is spreading"" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcast�s NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.""We�re seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,"" she told AFP.""We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so I�m sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.""For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.""These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,"" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.""We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,"" Layser said.

business,shanghai leads rout in asian ,"HONG KONG: Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about China�s slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the world�s number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this year�s gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.""Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,"" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.""The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of China�s economy) is inevitable.""Asia�s losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since China�s shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even Beijing�s huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.""This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,"" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.""If we don�t cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.""Oil prices also fell, after breaking below the $40 barrel for the first time in six years Friday on concerns about waning demand in China, the world�s top energy importer.Data showing the number of US drilling rigs rose last week, despite the slump in prices, added to concerns a global supply glut will last for years.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.28 to $39.58 while Brent crude for October eased $1.45 to $44.65.Jitters over China and the global economy saw traders drop the dollar and move into the yen -- a safe haven in times of turmoil and uncertainty -- while the currencies of Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea all hit fresh multi-year lows.The greenback fell to 121.23 yen in Asia Monday, down from 122.06 yen in New York Friday.

business,crude extends losses us oil trades below 40,"Singapore: Crude prices dived in Asia on Monday, with US oil hovering below the key $40 a barrel mark amid deepening concerns about weak Chinese economic growth and global oversupply, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for October delivery fell $1.04 to $39.41 while Brent crude for October eased 91 cents to $44.55 in late-morning trade.WTI extended losses after briefly dipping to $39.86 on Friday in New York -- breaking $40 for the first time in six years -- after data showed an increase in US oil rigs despite ample global supplies.""Soft manufacturing data from China and continued increase in weekly rig count led to the sharp sell-off"" in oil prices, said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at consultancy EY.The Baker Hughes US oil rig count showed producers in the world�s top crude consumer added two more rigs in the week to August 21, the same number as the previous week, bringing the overall tally of active drilling oil rigs to 674.A much weaker-than-expected manufacturing report on Friday also added to concerns energy demand is also waning in China.The Caixin�s Purchasing Managers� Index came in at 47.1 this month, falling from 47.8 in July and its worst reading since March 2009. A reading below 50 signifies contraction in activity.The poor data fuelled concerns about the world�s second-largest economy and top energy importer -- already heightened by Beijing�s unexpected devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago -- at a time when high production levels and weak demand growth are weighing on prices.Oil dealers will next be scrutinising preliminary US second-quarter GDP data to be released on Thursday, analysts said.The data could be key to the Federal Reserve�s timeline for raising interest rates, with predictions for a September raise fading in the face of global growth jitters.Interest rate adjustments are closely watched by crude investors as an increase usually leads to a pick-up in the dollar. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand.

business,pak rupee to remain stable sb,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. �SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies,� said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.�Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.�The statement added that, �Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities.� �SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.�

business,adb announces new 1.2 bn annual package for paki,"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the government�s ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement. The new programme, which runs until 2019, will target six sectors including energy, transport and public sector management, the ADB said. The funds will support improvements to highways and provincial roads, as well as to power generation and transmission and bus rapid transit schemes in Karachi and other cities.

business,shanghai stocks slump defying bounce in asian shar,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai stocks tumbled on Tuesday, extending the worst daily plunge for eight years after worries about China's faltering economy sent world financial markets reeling, but other Asian markets bounced back from heavy early losses.A slump in Chinese shares sparked panic across global markets on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York initially diving more than 1,000 points, or six percent, before trimming its losses, while European stocks fell sharply.The dollar and commodity prices plumbed fresh multi-year lows in New York, with US oil finishing below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years as fears of a global slowdown hit commodity markets.But Asian bourses cast off heavy early falls Tuesday to post gains by late morning, with Tokyo up 1.10 percent by the break after closing at a six-month low in the previous session.Hong Kong was 1.62 percent higher by the break while Sydney added 2.30 percent, Seoul climbed 1.32 percent and oil led a recovery among commodities as dealers took a breather after Monday�s rout.""Our bottom line is that the world�s still not a bad place,"" David McDonald of Credit Suisse told Bloomberg News.""It's just a case of whether you would want to rush in now or perhaps wait until it settles down a bit more.""China's benchmark index in Shanghai opened down 6.41 percent before recovering slightly to stand 4.33 percent off by the break.Slowing growth in Asia's largest economy has long kept investors on edge but China's shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago, following a string of weak economic data, has riled world markets.Fears Beijing could taper a massive share market rescue package helped push Shanghai down 8.49 percent on Monday, wiping out the year's gains in its biggest daily slump since February 2007. Capital Economics said investors had been ""overreacting about economic risks in China"", arguing that the ""collapse of the equity bubble tells us next to nothing about the state of China's economy"".'Step up'Chinese shares have been on a roller-coaster ride after a year-long debt-fuelled rally collapsed in mid-June, prompting the government to unleash a vast support package that has included using state vehicles to support the market.In the latest move, Beijing said on Sunday it would allow the state pension fund, which had 3.5 trillion yuan of assets at the end of 2014, to buy stocks.But mainland investors are worried that support could start to taper and they are now waiting to see if the ""national team"" will intervene further, or China�s central bank will loosen monetary policy.The People�s Bank of China, the central bank, said on Tuesday it had injected 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity.

Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations � those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi.

The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

The country�s annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market. ""Supplies are sometimes slowed down when the crop finishes in one area and harvesting begins in other areas...These days, onions from Balochistan are available in the markets nationwide."" Sindh would begin harvesting the new crop from October, and will continue in full swing until November-December. The crop would last till April 2016.He, however, said Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and UAE remain the biggest importers of Pakistani onion.Attributing the price fluctuation to the demand supply gap, Shahjahan said Malaysia has been importing 50-60 containers (of 25 tons each) every week, UAE 40-50 containers, whereas Sri Lanka buys 30-40 containers of onion from Pakistan every week. ""On a weekly average, Pakistan exports 8,000 to 10,000 tons of onion,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Baloch, another exporter, said ""I have just received an export order from Bangladesh, and I am evaluating the export price.""Reportedly, Bangladesh usually imports onion from India. The export country {India}, however, is itself experiencing shortage in local supplies and price-hike these days. The situation has also convinced Bangladesh to divert its import orders to other countries.Pakistan, a common neighbour to both the countries, with a local production estimated at 2.5 million tons this year, may help them overcome a part of their local shortages.Egypt, Iran, an Afghanistan may also help them overcome the crises, it was learnt.Baloch added that Pakistan could fetch higher exports than the estimated amount if the government did not set a maximum limit per exporter. ""According to the rules, one exporter cannot load more than one container of onion in each vessel� may be each vessel carries 100 containers.""Shahjahan added two to three vessels of onions leave the Karachi Port every week.

business,strike piles up trade cargoes prolonged stand off feared,"KARACHI: A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the country�s main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.�No one from government�s side came forward to negotiate with us,� he said.�We have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime Minister�s secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.�Even various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agents� leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.�Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses,� he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.�If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace,� he said. �And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.�He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didn�t issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders don�t work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said government�s non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The country�s exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didn�t seriously take the issue. It was only after 12 days, during which traders sustained huge losses the government came for negotiation with the protestors.He said the present government allows an issue to blow out of proportion before coming for the rescue.Fawad Ijaz Khan, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the government has failed to resolve the issues facing freight forwarders and air cargo agents.�We have been trying to contact the various ministries, including finance and commerce ministries, but no one was available to listen to our grievances,� Khan said.�Our members are worried about their consignments and their orders might be cancelled if not shipped on time.�Shabbir Ahmed, former chairman of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association said the government should seriously take notice of the matter and immediately resolve the issues of the logistics sector. Ahmed said small exporters will suffer the most due to the strike.

The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy�s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China�s booming economy began to slow, oil�s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC�s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

business,japan iran to start investment talks next ,"Tokyo: Japan and Iran will start talks next week to negotiate a bilateral investment treaty, as Washington moves to ease sanctions against Tehran and Tokyo looks to step up its interests in the resource rich nation.Japanese and Iranian officials will meet in Tehran from Monday through to Wednesday to secure a deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Friday, as other energy consumers also rush to explore Tehran�s commercial potential.""The aim of these negotiations is to protect the investment activities of Japanese companies,"" Suga told reporters at a regular briefing.When asked how resource-poor Japan would tap Iran�s energy potential, Suga said: ""Keeping those various factors in mind, Japan will take the necessary steps and not be later than other nations.""The move comes as Washington secures support in Congress for its nuclear deal with Iran, designed to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for the easing of US-led international sanctions.The historic deal was clinched in July after two years of negotiations to address Western concerns that Iran was developing a nuclear bomb -- a claim Iran denies.Japan hopes the lifting of sanctions will lead to increased auto exports to Iran and more Iranian energy imports, although Tokyo officials are bracing themselves for fierce international competition for market access, local media reported. Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised Japan�s nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in Iran�s atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.

business,oil prices mixed after weak chinese trade d,"Singapore: Oil prices were mixed in Asia Tuesday after the latest Chinese trade data showed lacklustre demand in the world�s top energy consumer, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.34 to $44.71 while Brent crude for October gained 44 cents to $48.07 in late-morning trade.The Chinese customs administration said Tuesday overseas shipments in August fell 6.1 percent in yuan terms from a year earlier. This compared with a fall of 8.9 percent in July.Imports dropped 14.3 percent, from an 8.6 percent decrease in July.""This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP.""China�s economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,"" he added.The data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the world�s second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth.Oil prices have come under pressure from concerns that China�s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels.Oil prices are down almost 30 percent from this year�s closing peak in May, according to Bloomberg News data.Analysts said dealers would next scrutinise the latest weekly US petroleum report due Thursday, a day later than usual due to a holiday on Monday.US crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak due to high production levels despite tepid demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.

business,dubai property developers upbeat despite falling pri,"DUBAI: Dubai property developers are still turning out some larger-than-life projects even though prices are heading south again after clawing back a good chunk of their losses in the 2008 crash.  The Gulf emirate�s annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by what�s going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  ""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the world�s highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the world�s tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break Dubai�s own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.  Dubai�s Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said Dubai�s market has ""matured"" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.

Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next week�s Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Street�s three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275.And the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents.The ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent.

business,government stresses coal based power generati,"KARACHI: The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.�With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning,� reads a Nepra�s decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.�Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development,� the authority said.�In short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.�The authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.�The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability,� read the ruling.�An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.�It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.

business,oil falls ahead of fed decisi,"London: Oil prices fell Thursday as jittery investors awaited a key interest rate decision from the US Federal Reserve.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in October dropped 58 cents to $46.57 a barrel from Wednesday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for November shed 60 cents to stand at $49.15 a barrel in London midday deals.Prices were lower as traders took profits after crude futures had soared Wednesday.WTI surged almost six percent and Brent jumped more than four percent after the US Department of Energy revealed a weekly drop of 2.1 million barrels in crude inventories.That included a 1.9 million-barrel decline at the Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub, indicating stronger demand in the world�s top oil consumer. The report also said US oil production fell for the sixth straight week.""For the oil market, the fact that US oil production was down once again may perhaps be even more relevant than the decline in stocks,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.""This would appear to prove OPEC�s strategy correct, namely that low oil prices would prompt shale oil producers to abandon production. In fact, this trend may well even accelerate in the near future.""World oil prices have roughly halved in value since a year ago, plagued by a global supply glut caused largely by cheaper production of US oil following extraction from shale rock.Attention is now focused on Washington where the Fed will make an announcement on borrowing costs, with analyst opinion split on whether it will begin lift-off of raising rates on Thursday or wait until December.Fed chief Janet Yellen has said she expects an increase in US interest rates by the end of the year but recent turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about China�s economy have complicated policymakers� decision-making.A rise in US interest rates tends to bolster the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand.

Investors from China, Korea, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have large equity contributions in these projects.�The government is making every effort to increase electricity supply to the national grid through all possible avenues, private sector being one of them,� Asif said.The said projects include 102MW Gulpur hydropower at Poonch River, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 720MW Karot hydropower at Jhelum River, district Rawalpindi, 870 MW Suki Kinari hydropower at Kunhar River, Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 1,320MW Port Qasim coal-based power, 660MW Engro Powergen coal-based power at Thar Block-II, Sindh, 1,320MW Shandong imported coal-based power at Qadirabad, Sahiwal, and 163MW Grange Holdings coal-based power at Arifwala, Punjab.

business,asian stocks currencies sink after china factory d,"Hong Kong: A plunge in a gauge of Chinese factory activity stoked fresh fears about the world�s number two economy and the global outlook Wednesday, sending Asian markets tumbling after a heavy sell-off in New York and Europe.Emerging market currencies -- already under pressure from an expected US interest rate hike and weak growth -- also took a battering as investors rushed into lower-yielding, or safer, assets such as the yen while oil prices eased.The losses extended a general downward spiral across the world as dealers fret over the state of the global economy, with a US recovery offset by China posting growth at 25-year lows, and Japan and the eurozone also struggling.On Wednesday China�s closely watched Purchasing Managers� Index (PMI) of manufacturing activity for September came in at a six-and-a-half-year low and showed the sector contracted further.The preliminary reading released by financial publisher Caixin came in at 47.0, down from August and missing expectations of 47.5. A result below 50 indicates shrinkage and anything above points to growth.""The decline indicates the nation�s manufacturing industry has reached a crucial stage in the structural transformation process,"" He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a statement accompanying the figures.He blamed the weakness mainly on sluggish external demand for Chinese goods and lower export prices.The figures come a day after the Asian Development Bank (ABD) said it had lowered its growth expectations for Asia because of the sharp growth slowdown in China, a key driver of global trade.""It�s a confirmation of fears that were existing in the market already that China is in fact doing worse than we had been led to believe and there�s a lot of uncertainty about where that economy really is,"" Emma Lawson, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.Among Asian stock markets Shanghai sank 0.88 percent, Hong Kong was 1.90 percent lower and Sydney -- where a number of firms with strong China links are listed -- shed 1.70 percent.Seoul, Taipei and Singapore were also each down more than one percent.

business,nepra makes consumers pay billions mor,"ISLAMABAD: Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies (Discos) by up to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent in 2004 in the power tariff, inflicting a loss of Rs2.1 billion per annum, reveals the government�s official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF, a copy of which is available with The News.Under the circular debt management plan, the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs314 billion (as of end of June 2015) to Rs212 billion by financial year ending June 30, 2018 while keeping within the target of 0.4 percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector (about Rs128 billion) and 4 percent fiscal deficit. �At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. �The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule.� Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner. For the Discos not privatized, the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service.

But the board meeting was cut short when hundreds of striking workers stormed into the airline�s headquarters in Roissy, outside Paris.Human resources manager Xavier Broseta ""was almost lynched"", according to one union delegate, and had his shirt ripped off as he clambered over barriers to escape, helped by security guards. CEO Frederic Gagey also made a hasty exit, and the board said the meeting would not resume on Monday.The management condemned the ""physical violence"", and said it would file complaints to the police. Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the violence was ""unacceptable"". ""They do nothing to advance the search for a solution for Air France,"" he said in a statement.The loss-making airline, which employs 52,000 people, is struggling in the face of fierce competition from global rivals.It had tried to convince pilots, who earn up to 250,000 euros ($280,000) a year, to fly 100 more hours annually for the same salary, but talks broke down last week with pilots saying the plan amounted to an effective pay cut. The French government, which owns a 17.6-percent stake, has criticised the pilots, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls denouncing their ""hardline"" attitude.""If Air France does not evolve then it puts itself in danger,"" Valls said at the weekend.- �Spectators to a crash� -Four unions announced a strike to coincide with Monday�s meeting. It was not clear how many staff were taking part, but the airline said flights would be unaffected beyond some check-in delays. Not all staff support the pilots, who also led a record-long strike a year ago that cost the company nearly half a billion euros.""Ground staff, stewards and hostesses feel they have made enormous efforts without ending up in a position to influence decisions,"" Beatrice Lestic, of the CFDT union, told Le Parisien newspaper. ""They are now spectators to a crash in which they will be the first victims,"" she said.Seeking to sharpen its competitive edge against main European rivals Lufthansa and British Airways-Iberia, the management�s new proposals include ending five long-haul routes, reducing the frequency of other flights, and selling 14 planes over the next two years.Although the company says it favours voluntary departures, Gagey has indicated compulsory redundancies may be necessary for the first time, ""otherwise we would not make hoped-for progress in terms of productivity"".Sources at Monday�s meeting said the plan includes the possibility of dismissing 300 pilots, 900 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,700 ground staff. The company already shed 5,500 posts via voluntary departures between 2012 and 2014 as it battled competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines. Pilots were also behind a record-long two-week strike in September 2014, which knocked 416 million euros off turnover and was described as ""catastrophic for the French aviation sector"" in a joint statement from key industry unions.The striking pilots opposed the expansion of Air France�s low-cost subsidiary Transavia.Air France, which merged with Dutch national carrier KLM in 2004, is trying to cut costs over two years by 1.8 billion euros.A source close to the deal told AFP Monday that as part of its cost-cutting plan, Air France is to enter into discussions about cancelling all or some of the Boeing 787s it has on order.The airline ordered 25 of the 787-9 Dreamliners in 2011.The source said: ""We are going to contact our suppliers from tomorrow to ask them if possible to cancel the scheduled delivery of the 787 planes.""Discussions will be opened and they could end in cancellations, that�s our approach.""

business,12 pacific countries seal huge free trade d,"ATLANTA: Twelve Pacific rim countries sealed the deal Monday on creating the world's largest free trade area, delivering President Barack Obama a major policy triumph.The deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, led by the United States and Japan, aims to set the rules for 21st century trade and investment and press China, not one of the 12, to shape its behavior in commerce to the TPP standards.""After five years of intensive negotiations, we have come to an agreement that will create jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development, and promote innovation across the Asia Pacific Region,"" said US Trade Representative Michael Froman. The hard-won deal to create the world�s largest free-trade area, encompassing 40 percent of the global economy, came after five days of round-the-clock talks in an Atlanta hotel.President Barack Obama, who made the TPP a priority of his second term, said the accord reached in Georgia ""reflects America�s values and gives our workers the fair shot at success they deserve."" ""When more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can�t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,"" Obama said in a statement. ""We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment.""More than 18,000 taxes imposed by various countries on US products will be eliminated thanks to the partnership, he added. - �Shape the future� -The accord involves significant market openings from Canada, the United States and Japan but also sets controversial new patent standards for cutting-edge biologic drugs and demands countries like Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia improve labor standards.""This agreement in my view is truly transformational,"" said Canada Trade Minister Ed Fast.""The magnitude and importance of rules for 21st century issues can�t be underscored enough.... It will shape the future for many trade agreements in this 21st century."" The talks went four days past deadline to resolve conflicts over Canada and Japan opening up their dairy markets to New Zealand exports, and objections from Australia, Peru and Chile to the US push for longer biologic patent protections.Trade ministers said the landmark deal addresses new issues like data trade, foreign investment protections and intellectual property that have not been covered in multilateral trade pacts of the past. New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said his side of the talks went to 5 am Monday morning before an agreement was set.The deal is ""profoundly important and beneficial to the generations of people in our respective countries,"" he said.The accord still must be signed and ratified by the respective countries, which also include Singapore and Brunei.In Canada, facing a national election in two weeks, and in the United States, with elections coming in one year, that could prove particularly difficult.US members of Congress have already warned that they will not ratify any deal that gives up too much in US interests.Powerful Senator Orrin Hatch warned Monday that he will scour the deal ""to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congress�s criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers.""

business,oil extends gains in asi,"Singapore: Oil extended gains in Asia Monday as a decline in US drilling pointed to a slowdown in production, but concerns over demand remain after a disappointing US jobs report.A report from Baker Hughes Inc. said the number of active rigs in the United States fell by 26 to 614 last week, the lowest in five years, helping ease concerns over the global crude oversupply that has depressed prices.But poor unemployment data from the US continued to weigh on the market.The US Labor Department said Friday that jobs growth in the world�s biggest economy and top oil consumer faltered in September and the labour market weakened across the board.This has stoked concerns about demand for the commodity at a time when the Chinese economy is also slowing down amid a crude supply glut, analysts said.The US economy added a disappointing 142,000 jobs during the month, well below analyst estimates of 205,000 and the August jobs level of 173,000 was revised sharply lower to 136,000, surprising analysts.The July number also was lowered, bringing the average for the past three months to 167,000 jobs, lagging behind the 200,000-plus growth trend seen earlier in the year and in 2014.The unemployment rate, measuring those without work but actively seeking jobs, was unchanged as expected at 5.1 percent, the lowest level since 2008.The jobs data suggested that the US economy was being affected by the China-driven global slowdown and market volatility.In morning Asia trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was up 11 cents to $45.65 and Brent crude for November jumped 15 cents to $48.28 a barrel.Both contracts also rose on Friday after a decline in US oil drilling bolstered hopes of lower production to ease the global oversupply.""The disappointing US jobs report for September will clearly do little to improve investor confidence in the global economy,"" research house Capital Economics said.""Yes, it will probably delay the first interest rate hike from the Fed until early next year.""Analysts had predicted the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates either this month or in December after policymakers held back during a meeting in September.The Fed has said the timing of a rate increase will depend on the health of the US economy.

business,oil prices sustain rally,"Singapore: Buoyant oil prices sustained a rally in Asia Wednesday driven by hopes the crude supply glut would ease and expectations the US central bank would hold off from raising interest rates.A softening of the US currency also helped bolster prices as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of weaker units, spurring demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery rose 55 cents to $49.08 and Brent crude for November advanced 40 cents to $52.32 a barrel in late-morning trade.Prices fell to six-year lows in August on strong production from the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but have since crept higher.The recent rally began last week after data showed a drop in US drilling activity, raising hopes this would help ease the oversupply.The US Department of Energy has forecast production to decline to an average of 8.9 million barrels per day next year from 9.2 million in 2015.Expectations that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would not raise interest rates this year because of the weak global economy also boosted oil prices, analysts said.""We no longer look for lift-off until the first quarter of 2016. It may not come then either,"" DBS Bank said.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said an interest rate hike seemed less likely after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for the world economy.The global economy will expand just 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF predicted, revising downward its previous forecasts by 0.2 percentage points in both cases.""It is no secret that the IMF wants the Fed to delay its planned rate hike until next year, and the economic undercurrents increasingly lean towards that direction,"" Aw said.""Furthermore, the IMF sees risks for emerging economies.""A rate increase will typically boost the dollar, making oil more expensive, hurting demand and prices.

business,water short pakistani farmers test less thirsty way to grow ri,"ISLAMABAD: Erratic monsoon rains have made it increasingly hard for rice farmer Sardar Muhammad to bring in a good harvest. But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields � rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province � is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.

This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers� Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears.

Japan�s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to a two-month high.The surprise move by China lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursday�s message from the European Central Bank that it stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates to even deeper negative levels.""These moves by the ECB and China are raising speculation that the Bank of Japan will act later on this week as well,"" Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Friday.The US Federal Reserve is also widely expected to refrain from raising rates at its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.Against these backdrop, the MSCI's index of the world's share markets shot up to its highest level since Aug. 20, having risen more than 10 percent from its two-year low hit less than a month ago.It has recovered most of the losses since Aug. 11, when China's sudden devaluation of the yuan sparked worries its economy may be in deeper trouble than many had thought.On Wall Street, S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to turn positive on the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent.Technology shares led the way, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported earnings results. The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.Mainland Chinese shares rose on Monday after China cut the benchmark one-year lending rate - for the sixth time in less than a year - by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent, and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio late.Gains were fairly limited, however, with Shanghai composite index up just 0.5 percent.Naoki Tashiro, the president of TS China Research, noted that in the week following each of the past year's five rate mainland shares rose three times but fell twice.""Mainland investors are cautious. The market has been rallying so far this month, so some investors could may well take profits into rally,"" he said.One big focus is Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a new five-year plan, while investors attempt to gauge how much China's growth is likely to slow in coming years.Ahead of the central committee meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.Risk sentiment supported by Thursday's message from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing.That saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them.The benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.As negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989 in early Asian trade. It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.""The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound. Markets are now expecting easing from the BOJ,"" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank.Despite a recovery in global equity prices, oil prices were softer, pressured by ongoing oversupply worries.Brent futures stood at $44.68, hardly recovering after a fall of 5.6 percent last week, not far from three-week low of $44.20 touched on Friday.

Fundamentals re-exerted themselves,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, told AFP.""There is a belief that US inventories are on the rise, which would prolong the global glut,"" he said.""The EIA on Wednesday will provide colour to the view.""In Asia, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for December delivery was trading 63 cents lower at $43.35 and Brent eased 43 cents at $47.11 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.Both contracts were down on Monday after stretching losses into a second week on Friday.The losses came after Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said at an energy conference in Singapore on Monday that it saw ""ample supply in the market"" until mid-2016.Prices fell to six-year lows in August but bounced back earlier this month to trade above $50, lifted by upbeat comments on the demand outlook from the head of the OPEC cartel of crude producers.The rally however was not sustained as oversupply concerns resurfaced. Current price levels are more than 50 percent below peaks of more than $100 reached in June last year.

business,rupee sinks to fresh two year low against dollar,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee on Wednesday slipped to a fresh two-year low of 105.80 against the US dollar in the interbank market, falling 56 paisa from its previous closing. In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country. Currency dealers say the growing demand is due to oil-related payments.""There were a few import payments in the market and banks were already short of them, and as the rupee crossed the 104.50 level it triggered 'stop', surging the rupee past the 105 figure,"" Eman Khan from Tresmark, an application that tracks financial markets, told The News on Tuesday. ""It's no coincidence that it happened on a day when the Finance minister initiated meeting with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and also when economic managers are assessing the damage from the deadly earthquake,"" Khan said. The talks between the IMF officials and the Pakistan's authorities on the ninth review of the extended fund facility program started on Monday in Dubai. Despite strong foreign exchange reserves and narrowing current account deficit, the rupee is constantly losing its value. The rupee depreciated 3.5 percent since the beginning of the current fiscal year.

business,oil rally fizzles as fed rate hike comments boost dollar,"Singapore: Oil prices tumbled in Asia Thursday, cutting short a rally the day before after hints of an interest rate hike in December by the US Federal Reserve boosted the dollar.Prices rose Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said the country�s commercial crude stockpiles had increased less than expected, suggesting stronger demand in the world�s top oil consuming nation.But the rebound was punctured after the Fed on Wednesday signalled it could raise rates before the end of the year, expressing optimism for the world�s top economy after ""solid"" consumer spending and business investment.""With the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rates hikes on Wednesday, the market will keep watch on the December meeting where a rate hike is likely in play,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.At around 0330 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 16 cents lower at $45.78 and Brent crude for December was down 21 cents at $48.84.US oil prices jumped more than six percent in Wednesday�s session after news domestic crude supplies rose less than expected in the week ending October 23.The news helped ease some fears over a glut of world supplies that experts warn could last well into next year, which has seen oil prices more than halve from last year�s highs.But the rally was cut short when the US central bank explicitly pointed to the possibility of a rate hike in its next meeting in December, dampening market predictions it could be held off until March.The news pushed the dollar higher -- an interest rate hike is bullish for the dollar as it attracts investors to the currency in the quest for higher returns.But because oil is traded in dollars, a strong US currency will make the commodity more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand and prices.""We are still expecting the Fed rate normalisation to be an eventuality and the latest Federal Open Market Committee decision further reaffirms our expectation for the first hike (since 2006) to take place in the 15-16 December 2015 FOMC (meeting),"" United Overseas Bank said.

business,asian stocks dollar retreat on weak chinese manufacturing d,"Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade Monday, while the dollar retreated against most regional currencies as a weak reading in a Chinese manufacturing index stirred worries about the world�s number two economy.On equity markets, there were losses across the board as Sunday data showed activity in China�s vast manufacturing sector declined in October for the third straight month, triggering worries about the Chinese economy, a crucial driver of global growth.Investors also turned to profit taking after equity markets surged last month, recovering from their worst quarter in four years during July-September, as analysts said fresh cues were needed for markets to rally further.China�s Purchasing Managers� Index (PMI), tracking activity in the factory and workshop sector, was unchanged from the previous month at 49.8, the state statistics office said Sunday.A PMI figure above 50 signals expanding activity while anything below indicates shrinkage.""I�m struggling to see catalysts to encourage the market to take this rally to the next level,"" said Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities Ltd.""China�s PMI numbers were underwhelming.

business,oil prices up in asia ahead of us crude inventories repor,"Singapore: Oil prices rebounded in Asia Tuesday, buoyed by bargain hunting ahead of the release of US government data that will gauge crude demand in the world�s biggest economy.Analysts expect the data to be released Wednesday by the US Energy Department to show that commercial crude stockpiles rose in the week to October 30 which typically means weaker demand in the world�s top oil consuming nation.Despite occasional rallies, oil remains generally bogged down by a global crude supply glut that has outpaced demand and depressed prices for more than a year.""Expectations of more US stockpiles restrained oil bulls,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.A global economic slowdown led by China has hammered demand for the commodity and highlighted worries that there may not be enough economic activity to soak up excess supplies as output levels from oil producing nations remain high.China�s official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector showed activity shrank in October for the third straight month.Russian oil production broke a post-Soviet record in October, climbing to 10.78 million barrels per day, according to Bloomberg News.At around 0310 GMT Tuesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was up 16 cents at $46.30 and Brent crude for December was trading 11 cents higher at $48.90 a barrel.Prices dipped on Monday after data showed China�s manufacturing output continued to contract and Russian oil production hit a new record high.Current price levels are more than 50 percent lower from their peaks in June 2014 when a barrel of oil was selling at over $100.

Despite the slender gains, prices are lower compared with the previous week as the market struggles with a crude oversupply and weak demand owing to sluggish global growth led by top energy guzzler China.Increasing talk of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve has also bolstered the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.A meeting last month of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hinted that a decision to implement the first rate hike since 2006 could be made during a December meeting.Comments this week by Fed chair Janet Yellen and New York Fed president Bill Dudley considered as ""hawkish"" by the market have firmed up expectations for the December FOMC meeting ""as a live possibility for the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade,"" Singapore�s United Overseas Bank said.Markets are watching the US non-farm payrolls data to be released later Friday for further signs about the health of the US economy which could help swing any decision on interest rates, it said.The data is a closely watched gauge of the unemployment situation in the world�s biggest economy and top oil consuming nation.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in June last year.The International Monetary Fund has projected slower growth for the world economy this year and next.

business,moodys ups pakistan banking system outlook to stab,"LIMASSOL: Moody�s Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the country�s economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the government�s commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.�We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central bank�s accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sector�s loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moody�s Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moody�s forecasts Pakistan�s real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks� asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks� creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation � a result of weaker profitability.Moody�s expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the market�s perception of Pakistan�s risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks� deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks� funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moody�s expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets � defined as cash and bank placements � at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.

""One of the main reasons is that we will launch our own national missile project,"" added the official.The news came as Turkey hosted key Western allies including US President Barack Obama but also Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the summit of G20 top economies in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.Turkey entered negotiations in 2013 with the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC) to finalise a contract worth $3.4 billion (3 billion euros).French-Italian consortium Eurosam and US-listed Raytheon Co had also submitted offers but the government had prioritised talks with the Chinese company, which raised serious concerns over the compatibility of CPMIEC�s systems with NATO missile defences.NATO has said missile systems within the alliance must be compatible with each other while calling on Turkey to take this factor into account.Turkish government sources said an official announcement was expected next week. A second Turkish official said the issue of technology transfer was one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Chinese company.""They refused to give what we demanded,"" the official told AFP, without elaborating.

It will just be a short selloff in response to the Paris attacks,"" he told Bloomberg News.In early trade Hong Kong was 1.2 percent off, Tokyo fell one percent and Sydney gave up 0.9 percent.Adding to selling pressure in Tokyo Monday was data showing the Japanese economy had slipped into recession for the second time in three years, throwing into question the government�s much-vaunted drive to kickstart growth and inflation.- Shanghai retreats -The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.2 percent in July-September, or 0.8 percent on an annualised basis, marking the second straight quarterly decline -- a technical recession.The preliminary figure was worse than the 0.1 percent decline forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and will put pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up its bond-buying scheme of monetary easing. The central bank is scheduled to hold a policy meeting this week.The soft results continue to flow despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe�s big-spending three-year plan -- dubbed ""Abenomics"" -- to revitalise the torpid economy and end years of debilitating deflation.Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute, told AFP: ""Companies are reluctant to invest despite their sound profits.""

business,oil prices up in asia but gains limited,"Singapore: Oil prices extended gains in Asia Tuesday but the uptick was capped as investors waited for data on US crude stockpiles expected to further underscore a global supply glut.Prices pushed higher on Monday after US-led coalition jets bombed the Daesh group�s oil operations following the deadly attacks on Paris, but analysts said the impact of geopolitical tensions on the oil market is limited.At around 0300 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was up six cents to $41.80 and Brent crude for January was trading 11 cents higher at $44.67 a barrel.The gains on WTI ""are really an exercise to defend the $40 handle, where we saw a 4.0 percent rebound after prices touched lows of $40.06,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""It�s difficult to see more upside potential, although we might be getting closer to the equilibrium price level where we meet the sweet spot in the supply and demand equation,"" he told AFP.He said investors are also cautious ahead of a US Department of Energy report Wednesday on commercial crude stockpiles in the week ending November 13.Analysts expect another build in the inventories, which would indicate weaker demand in the world�s top oil consuming nation.BMI Research said the geopolitical tensions sparked by the escalation of military action against IS following the Paris attacks is unlikely to be a major influence on oil prices.It pointed out in a commentary that the global market remains oversupplied, crude inventories in developed countries are at record levels and there is no direct threat to Middle East oil facilities and transit points.""There is no material threat to the oil-producing facilities and transit routes in the Middle East from the escalation of the French military effort in Syria,"" it said.""Namely, this refers to the oil facilities of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, southern Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), as well as the strategic chokepoints of Suez Canal, Bab el-Mandab and the Straits of Hormuz, all of which remain out of reach of military campaigns.""

business,sbp keeps policy rate unchanged at 6,"KARACHI:  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.

business,new tax amnesty scheme for traders in the offing,"ISLAMABAD: The government has old wine to offer in a new bottle to appease both the IMF and the traders in its bid to broaden the tax base. The strategy, however, offers no promise to arrest the flow of smuggled goods, one of the key reasons for the undocumented economy. The tax amnesty scheme for whitening black money of traders will be treated as �regularisation of money� as the IMF is opposed to any kind of amnesty. The government sees no other option to bring traders in the tax net, according to a well-placed official. Compared to past amnesty schemes, this measure will be for traders only. Although the government has taken a bold decision of daring traders community, the constituency of the ruling party, the current scheme lacks any strategy for checking the smuggled items that are available at cheap rates but without any invoicing, generating a chain of undocumented income and tax evasion at multiple level.�It is hard to fix all issues at once but we are trying to raise the cost of undocumented business through taxing banking transactions,� said an official privy to the ongoing deliberations when asked about the challenges to economy from the smuggled goods.Instead, the government is more focused on bringing the traders into the tax net by exempting them from tax audit at least for three-year allowing them declare their hidden assets and bank accounts, and in return they will gradually increase their tax payments during the amnesty period.�We have reminded traders that the era of benami transactions is going to be over soon,� said a tax official with reference to the legislation being drafted for tabling in Parliament early next year suggesting heavy penalty for offenders.The government will grant amnesty to the traders having undeclared assets if the declarations are made in the tax return and such return filers continue increasing their tax payment by 25% during the financial years exempted from scrutiny.Unlike the complicated tax return form for the regular taxpayers, one-page tax return is being designed for the traders in English and Urdu both benefiting from this scheme in order to facilitate their entry into the tax net.Another issue regarding the sales tax on the turnover is also being reduced from one percent to 0.25% in order to settle down long-standing dispute between the FBR and the traders. The traders have been objecting turnover on the total cost of product instead of total sale.Among other measures to address their concerns, regional-level committees of traders have been formed for meetings with the regional tax commissioners to discuss ways and means for ironing out differences.Right now, the government is in contact with two groups of traders headed by Khalid Pervez and Naeem Mir, both are Lahore-based.The former is said to be non-cooperative as he tends to politicise the entire issues even the tax notices that he received months ago alleging him of mis-declaration of bank accounts and assets.In tax year 2013, he declared a book shop in Urdu Bazara as his only business in addition to foreign remittances of four millions rupees and property income of three millions and paid tax Rs49,992, according to an FBR official. This was in contrast with the six undeclared bank accounts and plots as well as eight vehicles spotted by the FBR forming basis of issuing him a notice.Naeem Mir, on the other hand, has been cooperative and urging the government to launch an awareness campaign in order to counter the false propaganda, address their legitimate concerns in addition to educating traders about the benefits of being in the tax net.

business,oil prices gain ahead of opec meeting,"London: World oil prices rose this week on concerns that heightened geopolitical tensions could disrupt Middle East supplies despite a market awash with crude.Traders were turning their attention to next week�s OPEC output meeting to see if the oil producers� cartel will slash high output levels.The 12-nation OPEC, which counts the world�s biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia among its members as well as Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, holds a regular meeting in Vienna on December 4.Most analysts expect the cartel to stick to its decision taken at the last meeting in June, when OPEC defied calls to cut output despite sliding oil prices, so extending its strategy of preserving market share and fending off competition from the US shale energy boom.Keeping the status quo would see the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries� official production target left at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for four years -- following pressure from cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia on the other members.""We continue to believe that there will not be any change in Saudi or OPEC policy"" in Vienna, noted Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner.""Oil market oversupply will continue through next year, due to resilient US production -- even if it is declining -- high OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the gradual return of Iran starting in"" 2016, he added.OPEC member Iran last week said it would not negotiate with the cartel over a planned half million barrels per day oil production hike once sanctions are lifted.Despite a supply glut that has caused crude prices to more than halve over the past 18 months -- due primarily to high output from US shale rock but also owing to weaker Chinese demand -- Iran has consistently said it plans to up its output when nuclear-related sanctions are lifted under a deal agreed in July with world powers.Downward pressure on the oil market this week was meanwhile capped by the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.But reports that Russia is not taking military action against Turkey in retaliation eased fears that the tense situation in the region could escalate and disrupt Middle East oil supplies.Moscow said retaliatory measures would focus on using its leverage to tighten the screws on Turkey�s economy, including halting joint economic projects.Next week will see traders monitoring also the meeting of the Federal Reserve, when policymakers are expected to lift US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. A hike would likely boost the dollar, making oil priced in the US unit more expensive for holders of weaker currencies.By late Friday in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in January edged higher to $44.93 a barrel from $44.66 a barrel one week earlier.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January stood at $42.02 a barrel compared with $40.39 for the expired December contract one week earlier.

Shanghai was 0.1 percent lower after surging more than one percent at one point.- Eurozone boost -The benchmark index rose Monday and Tuesday, having plunged 5.5 percent at the end of last week on news that several top brokerages were being investigated as part of a crackdown after the summer�s market rout.However, the International Monetary Fund�s decision to include the yuan in its special drawing rights basket of elite currencies has provided some buying support.On currency markets talk of a slow rise in US rates weighed on the dollar, which retreated in New York to $1.0634 from $1.0566 and to 122.86 yen from 123.09 yen.The euro was also given support by data showing factory growth in the eurozone picked up the pace last month while unemployment tumbled, fuelling hopes the bloc is slowly recovering.The EU�s Eurostat agency said unemployment in the 19-country region fell to 10.7 percent in October, the best reading since January 2012. In Germany the rate sank to its lowest level since the country�s reunification in 1990.Dealers are awaiting a European Central Bank policy meeting this week to see if it ramps up its stimulus programme or, in light of the latest report, stands pat until the new year.Sydney stocks slipped despite a slight pick-up in the Australian economy in the July-September quarter, which Treasurer Scott Morrison said showed progress in shifting from a resources-fuelled boom to broader-based growth.- Key figures around 0300 GMT -Tokyo - Nikkei 225: down 0.1 percent at 20,002.12 (break)Shanghai - composite: DOWN 0.1 percent 3,452.12Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.2 percent at 22,427.61Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0620 from $1.0634 late TuesdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.95 yen from 122.86 yenNew York - Dow: UP 1.0 percent at 17,888.35 (close)London - FTSE 100: UP 0.6 percent at 6,395.65 (close)

business,opec decides against cutting oil output nigeri,"Vienna: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has decided against cutting its oil output to lift prices, its president and Nigerian oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said following a meeting here Friday.OPEC, whose members together pump out more than one third of world oil, is currently producing above its official target of 30 million barrels per day.""Given the present position of the economy of countries that are purchasing (oil) and the worldwide economy, we will retain production at current levels,"" said Kachikwu, who is minister of state for petroleum resources in Nigeria.OPEC is currently pumping out around 32 million barrels of oil per day.The cartel on Friday published no figures on output in its communique, as it awaits increased output from Iran after sanctions were lifted on the Islamic republic.""We cannot put a number now because Iran is coming, we don�t know when Iran will come, and we will have to accommodate Iran one way or the other,"" said OPEC Secretary General Abdullah el-Badri.""We decided to postpone this decision to the next OPEC meeting (in June) until the picture will be more clearer for us to decide on a number,"" he added.Despite oil prices plunging by more than 60 percent in 18 months, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and the cartel�s other Gulf state members are defying calls to reduce output -- in a year-long strategy of attempting to preserve market share and fend off competition from non-OPEC and world leading producers Russia and the United States.Saudi Arabia on Friday repeated the kingdom�s stance that it would be willing to cut as long as non-OPEC also reduces its output.""We have said on more than one occasion that we are willing to cooperate with anyone that will help balance the market... with us,"" Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters gathered at OPEC headquarters in Vienna.OPEC�s poorer nations -- notably Venezuela, Ecuador and Algeria -- had led the calls for a cut to help boost prices and in turn their badly-hit revenues.""Everyone is concerned about... the prices, no one is happy,"" said Iraq�s oil minister Adil Abd Al-Mahdi.OPEC on Friday confirmed that Indonesia had returned to the cartel after a near seven-year absence, bringing the number of member countries to 13.

business,global stocks fall as ecb underwhelms investor,"London: World stock markets churned lower Friday on lingering disappointment over ""underwhelming"" eurozone stimulus measures and ahead of key US jobs data.Equities had plunged Thursday as the European Central Bank�s latest stimulus plan disappointed investors, sparking a global sell off that spilled over into Wall Street and Asia.In late Friday morning deals, London lost another 0.2 percent, Frankfurt fell 0.6 percent and Paris also slid 0.6 percent, one day after the key indices shed between two and four percent in value.Speculation had swirled for weeks that the ECB would ramp up its bond-buying programme and loosen monetary policy to bolster growth and counter weak inflation.Hopes were stoked Wednesday by news that eurozone inflation languished at 0.1 percent in November -- far lower than the ECB�s official 2.0-percent target.The bank on Thursday cut deposit rates further into negative territory -- meaning lenders must pay to park cash with it and so look to loan more -- and extended the length of its bond purchases.- Huge let-down -However, the long-awaited announcement was seen as a huge let-down as it crucially failed to increase the size of the stimulus while the rate cut was less than hoped for.""Equity markets took a notable shake out yesterday in response to the underwhelming actions of the ECB,"" said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.""The central bank�s stimulus measures fell some way short of expectations, initiating degree of panic across the board.""This rattled US markets after the European close last night and is once again taking a toll in early trade as the week�s final session gets underway.""The news sent the euro surging on Thursday to a one-month peak at $1.0981, having earlier hit a 7.5-month low of $1.0524 in highly volatile deals.""Draghi failed to deliver on investors� expectations,"" said ETX Capital analyst Daniel Sugarman.""In November the ECB governor had stated that the ECB would �do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible� -- which investors took to mean the unveiling of a significant surge in monetary stimulus in December.""The single currency had come under fierce selling pressure leading up to the announcement as dealers positioned themselves for more far-reaching measures.- Fed caution -The euro�s gains were also given support after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said the bank remained wary of a US interest rate rise because of concerns about a strong dollar and other central banks� loose monetary policies.While the Fed is still widely expected to lift rates this month -- for the first time in nine years -- Yellen�s comments caused traders to baulk after a recent run-up in the dollar. Dealers are now awaiting the release of key US jobs data later in the day, although analysts say the report would need to be monstrously bad to prevent a Fed rate rise in December.Asian stocks finished in the red, with Tokyo down 2.2 percent, Shanghai shedding 1.7 percent and Sydney 1.5 percent lower.Oil prices rose Friday amid OPEC�s policy meeting in Vienna, where the cartel appears on course to maintain crude production levels despite a recent plunge to underneath $40 per barrel.- Key figures around 1130 GMT -London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,263 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.6 percent at 10,728Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.6 percent at 4,702 EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.4 percent at 3,149Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.2 percent at 19,504.48 (close)New York - Dow: DOWN 1.4 percent at 17,477.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0876 from $1.0947 in late US trade on ThursdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.80 yen from 122.61 yen

He said if the opposition has objections over the ordinance, it can go ahead and present a resolution for its rejection in the lower house. He said the matter will be discussed with the opposition leader in the National Assembly and thereupon the speaker may constitute a committee to look into the issue.Defending the government�s decision to impose additional taxes, Ishaq Dar said there was a tax shortfall of Rs40 billion. He said taxes have either been imposed or raised only items that fall in the category of luxury goods.He said 58 percent of the proceeds from additional taxes will go to the provinces� kitty while the federation will only receive its one third.

The metal got a boost on Monday as the dollar fell after data from the Chicago Federal Reserve suggested the U.S. economy grew at a below average pace in November.""The jump in gold-ETF demand is impressive after the string of losses over the past couple of years, but the market will likely need to see further accumulation for the rally to be extended,"" said HSBC analyst James Steel.""A major stumbling block for a further gold rally is oil, and commodity prices in general,"" he said, adding that oil is a powerful drag on gold.Crude oil slid to its lowest levels since 2004 on Monday and more declines could ignite deflation fears. Bullion is often seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation.SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold ETF, saw its assets rise by nearly 19 tonnes on Friday, the first increase in two months and the biggest in four years. But that was followed by outflows of three tonnes on Monday.Holdings of the fund had hit a seven-year low earlier in the month, as investors positioned themselves for higher interest rates in the United States.While persistent inflows into the fund can boost gold prices, a further slump in oil could undermine any rally.Also in focus was the pace of the Fed's future rate hikes. The Fed last week raised U.S. interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Investors fear higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold, while boosting the dollar.The Fed's promise of gradual rate hikes in coming months means the central bank will not raise rates at every meeting, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday.

Only about 5,000 WTI contracts have changed hands so far during this trading session on Monday versus 8,953 contracts at this point in the trading session on December 7.The US market tightened slightly in December following reduced drilling activity, withdrawals from near record crude stockpiles and the prospect of crude exports following a 40-year export ban.""The biggest adjustment to prices comes from WTI gaining premium over the Brent.

business,Crude oil prices drop more than 1 per,"strong>SINGAPORE: Crude oil futures fell around half a dollar early on Wednesday as the market remained under pressure from slowing demand and high supplies, while forecasts that a cold snap in Europe and the United States would be short-lived also hurt prices.</strongCrude prices have plunged by two-thirds since mid-2014 as soaring output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and the United States led to a global surplus of between half a million and 2 million barrels per day.More recently, a slowing demand outlook, especially in Asia but also Europe, has started dragging on prices.Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading at $37.18 per barrel at 0140 GMT, down 69 cents or 1.82 percent from their last settlement. Brent futures were down 47 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $37.32 a barrel.Traders said the price falls were largely a result of a weak outlook for next year and the closing of 2015 trade books.""The 2016 outlook is for lower prices, especially early next year. Many are closing their last long positions for the year today as nobody wants to come back in January and be surprised badly. Better start with a clean sheet,"" a trader said.Forecasts that an upcoming cold weather in Europe will only be short-lived could also hurt crude prices.U.S. crude and Brent had both rallied about 3 percent in the previous session on hopes that a drop in temperatures would buoy demand for oil for heating purposes.But weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that average continental European temperatures are expected to drop from around 5 degrees Celsius currently towards and slightly below the seasonal norm of 2.4 degrees by Jan. 3 before rising to as high as 6-8 degrees by Jan. 7.For most of the United States, a brief cold period is also not expected to last for much more than a week.",12/30/2015,,

For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Ni�o weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.""We have brimming oil inventories in Europe,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. ""And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.""Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that ""headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.""The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. ""The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks,"" it said.strong>INDUSTRY PAIN</strongBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.",1/1/2016,,

business,Saudi Iran split dashes chance of OPEC deal to curb oil glu,"LONDON: The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shi�ite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the world�s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016. The world is now producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it is consuming, and Iran is promising to add another million bpd to supply over the next 12 months.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree any caps on production at its annual meeting in Vienna last month, amid acrimony between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Gulf region�s main Sunni and Shi�ite powers.If there was still any suggestion that the two rivals might somehow overcome their animosity to agree to manage supply this year, it was buried on Monday when Riyadh called off diplomatic ties with Tehran over Iran�s response to the execution of Saudi<br/>Shi�ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.Several OPEC delegates told Reuters they now saw no chance of any improvement in relations between OPEC members, which have been already very low over the past months.<br/><br/>""This new situation will just make it worse and I see no agreement to be reached within OPEC,"" one representative to OPEC from a member country outside the Gulf region said, on condition of anonymity.",1/6/2016,,

In June it had forecast 0.7 percent GDP growth for 2016. The bank estimates the Russian economy shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.In Brazil, GDP is forecast to decline by 2.5 percent in 2016 compared with an earlier estimate for growth of 1.1 percent, the World Bank said. The Brazilian economy likely contracted at a 3.7 percent rate in 2015.China GDP growth was estimated to slow to 6.7 percent in 2016 from an estimated 6.9 percent in 2015. In June the bank had estimated 2016 growth of 7.0 percent.The South African economy should grow at a modestly faster rate in 2016 than last year - 1.4 percent compared with 1.3 percent - but substantially slower than the 2.1 percent growth forecast in June.Of that group, India was the only one expected to see notable improvement in economic performance from 2015 - advancing at a 7.8 percent rate in 2016 versus 7.3 percent in 2015. But even there, the bank nipped its 2016 estimate by 0.1 percentage point from its earlier forecast.The bank also trimmed its outlook for the United States and other developed economies.The U.S. economy should grow by 2.7 percent, down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent but up from 2015's 2.5 percent.Estimates for growth in the euro zone were trimmed by the same amount, to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent previously, although that would mark a modest acceleration from 2015's estimated 1.5 percent rate.",1/7/2016,,

Trading on its stock markets was suspended for the rest of the day.Global oil prices have crashed 70 percent since mid-2014 as near record output from major producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and North America create a ballooning overhang that has left storage tanks around the world struggling to cope with the excess oil.At the same time, demand is slowing, especially in Asia where the biggest economy and energy consumer, China, is seeing the slowest economic growth in a generation.Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell to new 11-year lows of $33.09 per barrel on Thursday, undercutting a low from a day earlier, although prices edged back to $33.52 per barrel by 0213 GMT.Traders said a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which might normally be seen as posing a risk to oil supplies, may actually be bearish as it all but eliminates cooperation over production between the two OPEC members.""Neither one of them (Saudi Arabia or Iran) is going to voluntarily cede a single barrel to the other, so it arguably makes a coordinated production cut even less likely than it has been,"" one Middle East oil trader said.In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures set fresh 2009 lows of $32.77 per barrel, with prices crawling back to $33.25 by 0213 GMT.Analysts said that the huge U.S. storage overhang was the main reason for falling WTI crude.""Data suggest gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles increased 10.6 million barrels and 6.3 million barrels, respectively, last week. The rise in gasoline and distillate inventory more than offset the fall in crude oil inventory levels by 5.09 million barrels to (still near record) 482.3 million barrels last week,"" ANZ bank said.The huge storage overhang means that even if U.S. production falls this year as drillers succumb to low prices, it will take many months to work down excess supplies.With the global economy looking shaky due to China's slowdown, traders said the outlook for oil remains for cheap prices for much of this year.",1/7/2016,,

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall 8.0 percent and imports to fall 11.5 percent.While investors harbour suspicions about the reliability of the data, on the surface they offered hope that world trade flows were at least stabilising after a dismal 2015.It also suggested Beijing might prove successful in its increasingly forceful attempts to stabilise the yuan, so dampening fears of a sustained devaluation.All of which galvanised currency markets where the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, was up half a U.S. cent at $0.7036.With safe-haven suddenly out of favour, the Japanese yen and the euro eased broadly. The U.S. dollar moved up to 118.22 yen from an early 117.61, while the euro slipped to $1.0815 from $1.0860.Against a basket of currencies the dollar gained 0.2 percent.Likewise, low-risk sovereign debt had to surrender a little of their recent gains and yields on 10-year paper nudged up 3 basis points 2.137 percent.The hint of firmer demand from China provided a reprieve for commodity prices, which have been under the hammer for months.U.S. crude edged up 44 cents to $30.88 a barrel a day after diving as deep as $29.93 to break the $20 barrier for the first time in 12 years.Benchmark Brent was quoted 31 cents higher at $31.17 a barrel.

Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining capex and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong.",1/18/2016,,

However, meteorological data in Reuters shows that the current cold snaps will likely to be short-lived.The cold weather in North America and Europe follows an extremely mild start to the winter in large parts of the northern hemisphere that had led to weaker-than-usual demand for oil, exacerbating a plunge in prices earlier this year.Traders said that a lot of people with open short positions in the market, which profit from falling prices, had decided to cash in when prices plunged 30 percent between the beginning of the year and the middle of this week. They have now flipped into buying at low costs, lifting oil futures.""More stable global markets are likely to see speculative buying re-emerge in commodities that have suffered heavy losses in recent weeks. However, these rallies are likely to remain short-lived,"" ANZ bank said.Analysts said the fundamental reason for low oil prices remained unchanged, with producers around the world pumping over 1 million barrels of crude every day beyond demand, leaving storage tanks brimming.US crude inventories rose 4 million barrels in the last week, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""At 486.5 million barrels, US crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years,"" the EIA said.",1/22/2016,,

business,IEA sees global oil glut worsening OPEC deal unlikely,"strong>LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.</strongThe agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.�",2/9/2016,,

U.S. crude futures also jumped back above $30.As risk sentiment improved, yields on top-rated government bond rose, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rising 4.7 basis points to 1.793 percent from 1.746 percent at the end of last week.The Bank of Japan started implementing negative interest rates on Tuesday. The benchmark interbank lending rate fell to zero percent but not to negative levels partly because some banks have not fixed their system to deal with negative rates.",2/16/2016,,

""We have repeatedly said that Iran will increase its crude output until reaching the pre-sanctions<br/>production level.""The freeze plan has so far failed to push up oil prices, due to concerns Iran would not participate and that a deal would do little to ease the global glut as it would still allow Russia and Saudi Arabia to keep pumping at near record levels.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino, Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada sat down with Zanganeh at 3 p.<br/>m. (1130 GMT).The sanctions, imposed over Iran�s nuclear programme, were lifted last month after an agreement with world powers, allowing Tehran to resume selling oil freely in international markets.Iran exported around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude before 2012, but sanctions cut that to around 1.1 million bpd.Tehran has pledged to raise supply by around 1 million bpd in the next 6-12 months.",2/17/2016,,

The U.S. government will release official stockpile data on Thursday.Options expiry in U.S. crude also fed Wednesday's rebound, some traders said.Some investors said they had a better outlook for oil now.""I'm pricing between $35 and $45 for Brent by summer, as we still have a daily surplus of up to 1.7 million barrels of oil to contend with,"" said Phil Davis, an independent crude trader at PSW Investments.Others were more skeptical.

But the metal has given back some of those gains as markets have stabilised.The volatility index, which measures implied volatility of stock options and is often seen as an investor fear gauge, fell below 20 percent this week, hitting the lowest closing level since early January.HSBC's Steel said the recent decline in gold prices doesn't mean the rally is over, adding that demand for bullion exchange traded funds and possible weakening of the dollar could support the metal.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 2.64 percent to 752.29 tonnes on Monday, the highest since March 2015.The 19.33-tonne inflow matches Friday's increase, which was the fund's biggest single-day inflow since August 2011.The fund's inflows since the beginning of the year have already surpassed outflows for the whole of 2015.Among other precious metals, silver ticked up after hitting a two-week low of $14.90 an ounce on Monday.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 21 cents at $32.86.""Capping production at January levels, when the market was pumping out well over a million barrels of crude a day above what consumers need, will in no way reduce overcapacity. In fact, given that Iran has started to return to markets since January, it'll worsen the glut,"" said one senior oil trader.Iran is hoping to increase its crude exports by 1 million barrels per day within the next year after international sanctions against it were lifted in January. The sanctions had cut Iran's exports by more than half from a pre-sanctions peak of almost 3 million barrels per day in 2011.Despite the glut, prices did receive some support this week from strong demand for gasoline, especially in the United States.""The idea that gasoline demand is actually rising suggests that perhaps the lower prices of crude are actually prompting a greater usage of this product (gasoline),"" said Vyanne Lai, oil analyst at National Australia Bank.""I think the market is reading this as a positive sign in terms of demand.""",2/26/2016,,

business,Asian shares slip after G20 Fed ang,"strong>TOKYO: Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use ""all policy tools � monetary, fiscal and structural � individually and collectively"" to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.""The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it,"" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.""In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it,"" he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to ""consult closely"" on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rate""The US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of ""Brexit"" offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against ""Brexit"" in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.",2/29/2016,,

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped to their highest since early January on Wednesday.Shares got a boost after data showed US manufacturing appeared to stabilize in February, with production accelerating and new orders holding steady at higher levels.The economic outlook was further bolstered by another report on construction spending that scaled a more than eight-year high in January.The US dollar rebounded against the yen and hit one-month highs against the euro on Tuesday, making commodities priced in the greenback expensive for holders of other currencies.Investors will be watching more US data to gauge the impact on stocks and the Fed's monetary policy, with the most important one being US non-farm payrolls on Friday.So far this year, gold has gained 16 percent as turmoil in equity markets and concerns over the global economy triggered speculation that the Fed will not raise US interest rates any further this year. The US central bank hiked rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December.For now, gold is also drawing support from flows into bullion-backed exchange traded funds (ETF). Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold ETF, rose 1.15 percent to 786.20 tonnes on Tuesday, the highest since September 2014.In physical markets, India's gold imports in January surged 62 percent compared with the same period last year, news agency NewsRise Financial reported on Tuesday, citing a government official.",3/2/2016,,

Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.8 percent, on top of a 4-percent jump the previous session.""Value is starting to snap back and some sectors that pretty recently were hanging around all-time lows are showing signs of life,"" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.""The general updraft in oil is helping confidence as well. Investors aren't yet ready to take on a lot of risk, but they are adding to their positions.""Energy and bank stocks had led Wall Street higher on Wednesday, giving the Dow a gain of 0.2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.41 percent and the Nasdaq 0.29 percent.The calmer mood showed in the CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, which closed at its lowest level so far this year.Sentiment was underpinned by a report showing US private sector jobs rose a surprisingly strong 214,000 in February, adding to speculation Friday's payrolls report would also be upbeat.strong>NOT SO FAST</strongYet fissures remain in the global outlook, argued Justin Fabo, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank.Despite the latest bounce in commodities, prices were still very weak and a lot of money had been borrowed on the assumption that they would not be.""China has huge potential to roil markets as the nation navigates a difficult structural transition,"" he said.

The dollar also faded a little on the yen to 113.70, after losing grip of a two-week high at 114.56.Instead, the limelight was stolen by the Australian dollar which neared its 2016 peak in the wake of surprisingly strong domestic economic data.The Aussie was taking in the view at $0.7306, up 0.3 percent on the day following a 1.7 percent rally on Wednesday.Investors warmed to the currency after data showed fourth quarter economic growth unexpectedly picked up to a healthy 3.0 percent annual clip.",3/3/2016,,

China's export data was horrendous,"" Matt Smith of Clipper Data said in a daily report.China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years.Although China imported record crude volumes of 8 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, analysts expect this figure to fall as the government scales back purchases of strategic reserves, and car sales begin to fall as the sharpest economic slowdown in a generation starts to show results.The price dips at least temporarily halted a price rally that started in mid-February on hopes that a coordinated freeze in production would stop growth in a global supply glut of at least 1 billion bpd above consumption that helped pull prices down as much as 70 percent since 2014.But OPEC-member Kuwait, this week poured cold water on hopes of such a freeze by stating that it would only cap output if all major producers participate, including Iran, which has balked at the plan.One key factor in determining the oil market balance will be US output, which the government said would be 8.19 million bpd in 2017, down from over 9 million bpd currently.But with demand growth also slowing, many analysts including influential bank Goldman Sachs, say that it will take time for markets to fully rebalance.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that it expects ""the annual average (oil) price for 2016 being lower than 2015 and then recovering in 2017, reflecting large oversupply and high stock levels during the first half of 2016"".It added that the main risks to its forecast were changes in demand in China and the extent to which Iran manages to increase oil exports after sanctions against it were lifted in January.",3/9/2016,,

business,Asia markets slip before BOJ Fed oil sli,"strong>HONG KONG: Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday and the dollar firmed as investors braced for policy decisions from major central banks this week, with all eyes on the Bank of Japan's decision later in the day after it stunned markets in January by adopting negative rates.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.7 percent, backing off a 2-1/2-month high on Monday.It was dragged down by a 1.2 percent fall in resource-heavy Australian shares and a 0.7 percent drop in Hong Kong.""Markets are not expecting another round of stimulus so soon after January's surprise from the BOJ and overall sentiment has become more cautious after the recent risk rally,"" said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.With the global economy slowing and many countries facing deflationary pressures, investors' attention was squarely on policy decisions from the world's major central banks.The Bank of Japan is expected to announce its policy decision between 0230-0430 GMT on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank on Thursday.The BOJ is widely expected to keep policy unchanged after its surprise decision in January to introduce negative interest rates raised worries about banks' profitability.Notwithstanding the BOJ's decision, Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citibank, reckons investors are more interested in the Fed statement on Wednesday to gauge how important global vulnerabilities stack up against an upswing in domestic activity for U.S. policymakers.The Fed is unlikely to raise rates this week but it will likely make clear that as long as U.S. inflation and jobs continue to strengthen, economic weakness overseas won't stop rates from rising fairly soon.A consensus in the market is that fresh forecasts from the Fed's 17 officials released after the meeting will signal perhaps two or three rate hikes this year, a retreat from their projection in December for four or more increases in 2016.Financial markets are much more cautious with Fed fund futures are pricing in a 50 percent probability of a rate increase by June and one full rate hike by December.The mood in credit markets also was noticeably more cautious, with investors happy to stay in high quality government debt such as U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rather than venturing into higher-yielding corporate paper.The 10-year U.S. notes yield stood at 1.969 percent, off a six-week high of 1.986 percent hit on Friday.In credit markets too, a recent rally seems to be petering out. An index of high yield credit fell after rising 9 percent over the last month.Even oil prices, whose rebound over the last month triggered a global rally in risky assets, were running out of steam on concerns that a six-week market recovery may have gone beyond fundamentals. U.S. crude stockpiles continue to rise and Iran is seen showing little interest in joining major producers in freezing production.U.S. crude futures last traded at $37.05 a barrel, up slightly from Monday.On Monday, they fell 3.4 percent to $37.18 a barrel, while Brent finished down 2 percent at $39.53.In currency markets, the euro slipped further from its three-week high hit after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated he does not plan further cuts in interest rates.The euro traded at $1.1111, off Thursday's high of $1.1218.

That data is expected to show crude inventories rose to a record for a fifth straight week.""For today, we may see some strength for prices coming from possible US production declines,"" said Singapore-based Phillip Futures in a note today, although it does not expect US and Brent prices to rise higher than $39.83 and $40.17 per barrel, respectively.US shale producer Linn Energy said on Tuesday that bankruptcy may be unavoidable as the company missed interest payments amid a slump in oil prices of as much as 70 percent since mid-2014.Other companies, also fighting for survival, are seeking risky and costly borrowing from private equity firms.Despite Wednesday's price rises, oil markets remain dogged by a global glut which sees over 1 million barrels of crude pumped every day in excess of demand.And analysts warned that a recent bull-run which saw crude markets jump over 40 percent from multi-year lows earlier this year was overblown and largely driven by speculative traders buying crude from producers who were selling it as a financial hedge.""Producers are not buying the rumour-mill... In fact, it is just the opposite: speculators are buying what producers are selling... Speculators are record long Brent (on ICE) while producers are record short... Who do you think is going to win out?"" said the US-based The Schork Report in a note to clients.Fundamentally, there are few changes to the supply balance.While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to freeze their output at January volumes, near record levels of over 10 million barrels per day (bpd) each, Iran has said it would only participate once its production hits 4 million bpd from a current 3 million bpd.""Any such deal (to freeze output) would still not be a game changer. It would really just maintain the excess supply that is now in place,"" Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics said in a note.",3/16/2016,,

Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.""Despite the current rally in risk, we are more inclined to be broadly bearish on emerging markets given the underlying weakening trend,"" said Frances Cheung, head of rates strategy, Asia ex-Japan at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.Stocks in China and Hong Kong rose, but equity markets elsewhere in the region edged lower with Taiwan and Australia leading losses.In the absence of any fresh major economic data in a holiday-shortened week, investors were left to ponder the softer tightening bias from the Fed even as the US economic recovery appeared to be gathering fresh steam.Dollar bulls were hit hard last week after the Fed's less hawkish stance which cut the projected rate hikes for the rest of the year by half to only two. Financial markets, as seen by money market futures, are barely pricing in one.Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded doubtful that a recent firming in US inflation would be sustained, suggesting the central bank is in no hurry to tighten policy.Some such as Francis Cheung, China strategist at brokerage CLSA, said the Fed's renewed caution would encourage Beijing to pursue with its own stimulus measures to boost the economy. He expects an interest rate cut in the second quarter.""We see this rally continuing until the second quarter with property materials, internet and industrials sectors in demand,"" CLSA's Cheung said pointing to relatively cheap valuations.On a trailing price-to-earnings basis, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan is trading at 12.3 times, nearly one standard deviation below its 20 year average. At 9.3 times, Hong Kong's stock market was trading comfortably below one standard deviation its 20-year average.China's economy is showing signs of improvement while capital outflows from the country are moderating, top Chinese officials said on Sunday.Easing outflows and the softer dollar are resulting in less pressure on the yuan currency, which could give the central bank more confidence to cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirements again after largely weak data in January and February, some market watchers say.However, softer oil prices dampened sentiment.Oil slipped for a second session, extending Friday's slide of over 1 percent after the US rig count rose for the first time since December, renewing worries of a supply glut after an output freeze proposal had helped boost the market to 2016 highs.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell more than 1 percent to $39.01 per barrel after briefly topping $41, its highest since last December.Brent crude edged lower to $41.04 per barrel after hitting this year's peak of $42.54 per barrel.Rate markets also cheered the Fed's cautiousness with 10-year and two-year US yields down by 14 and 16 basis points since the US central bank's meeting last week.Credit markets basked in the afterglow of the recent rally with an index of high-yield credit extending gains to be up 9 percent in roughly a month.In currencies, the dollar index was little changed at 95.01, not far from a five-month trough of 94.578 set on Friday.The greenback fetched 111.31 yen, still within reach of Friday's 17-month low of 110.67.

The US oil rig count now stands at 372, the lowest since November 2009.US crude's front-month contract CLc1 settled down 33 cents at $39.46 a barrel, recovering from a session low of $38.33. For the week, it rose two cents, finishing up for a sixth straight week.Brent's front-month LCOc1 settled down 3 cents on the day at $40.44 a barrel, after an earlier drop to $39.22. For the week, it fell 76 cents, or nearly 2 percent, its first decline in six weeks.Despite the stumble, oil prices remain about 50 percent higher from multi-year lows hit in January from glut worries. While declining US oil output and strong gasoline demand were responsible for some of that recovery, the bulk of it was powered by major producers' plans to freeze output at January's highs.While this week's drop of oil 15 rigs was not a game changer to the market, it offered a reprieve to worries that there was a daily glut of some two million barrels in crude.""After last week's increase of one rig, some may have assumed that the continuing decrease in rig counts was finally abating,"" said Pete Donovan, broker at Liquidity Futures in New York. ""Apparently not so.""Others braced for further price weakness from more US inventory builds.""We see limited bullish assistance to the complex from a fundamental vantage point,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil consultancy Ritterbusch &amp; Associates.Shares on Wall Street, trading in tandem with crude most of this year, also clawed back from the lows of the day, helping oil recover.The dollar meanwhile, erased early gains that made oil and other commodities denominated in the greenback less affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.Volumes in oil were thin ahead of the Good Friday and Easter break, making it easier to retrace losses after sentiment swung.",3/25/2016,,

Growth is projected to slow further to 6.3 percent in 2017, ADB said.The bank's 2016 forecast for China, down from a December estimate of 6.7 percent, is at the lower end of Beijing's own target of 6.5-7 percent as the government presses ahead with painful reforms, though Premier Li Keqiang has vowed that would not lead to a hard landing.Weak prices for oil and other commodities also cast a shadow over the prospects of Asia's commodity-dependent economies, the ADB said.In the United States, expanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external demand, the ADB said. US Federal Reserve policymakers have cited continuing risks from a shaky global economy in halving the number of potential interest rate hikes this year to two.Growth in India will slip to 7.4 percent this year from 7.6 percent in 2015, but should recover to 7.8 percent in 2017, the ADB said.For all of South Asia, ADB forecast growth at 6.9 percent in 2016 and 7.3 percent in 2017, versus growth of 7.0 percent last year.Economies in Southeast Asia are projected to expand 4.5 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in 2015, and by 4.8 percent in 2017.For East Asia, ADB sees growth at 5.7 percent in 2016 and 5.6 percent in 2017. The region grew 6.0 percent last year.Central Asia is estimated to expand by 2.1 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2017, following growth of 2.9 percent in 2015, the bank said.Annual inflation in developing Asia is expected to recover to 2.5 percent this year from 2.2 percent in 2015 as domestic demand strengthens, ADB said.

And, this exercise revealed that value of goods declared to the customs of shipping country at the time of export of these goods is much higher than the invoice value declared before the customs.�Directorate General of Customs Valuation is requested to examine the issue carefully to re-fix the import trade price of the subject goods,� Rehman said.Under-invoicing is a major source of revenue leakage at import stage.

Overnight, it dropped 1.6 percent, its biggest fall in almost two months.While global risky assets has staged a smart recovery since February's lows, led by Chinese stock markets on hopes that Beijing can successfully avert a sharp slowdown, policymakers and investors are worried the recovery may be at best, bumpy, or at worst, short-lived.Alex Wolf, emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments said it is still too early to call an economic stabilization in China because property inventories are still very high and much of the recent economic activity was driven by quasi-fiscal spending.""A rebound based on property exuberance and quasi-fiscal stimulus means it might be more transient than the market wants to believe,"" he said in a note.Data last week showed foreigners are estimated to have pumped $36.8 billion into emerging market stocks and bonds in March, the highest monthly inflow in nearly two years, the Institute of International Finance said.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.01 percent on Tuesday as investors took profits on recent gains ahead of a quarterly reporting season that is expected to reveal sharply lower earnings.In addition, the US trade deficit widened more than expected in February in the latest indication that economic growth in the world's largest economy weakened further in the first quarter.The data prompted economists to cut their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 0.4 percent annualized rate, which would be its slowest growth in two years.Risk aversion was evident in currency and fixed income markets as well.Investors also bought back the yen, a low-yield currency that investors often sell to seek higher yields elsewhere when risk appetite is strong.The yen hit a 17-month high of 109.92 to the dollar on Tuesday after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said countries should avoid seeking to weaken their currencies with ""arbitrary intervention."" It last traded at 110.48.His comments dimmed any prospects of currency intervention by the Japanese authorities to stem the yen's rise in the near future, analysts said.The euro was little changed at $1.1376, hovering not far from its 5 1/2-month high of $1.1438.German 10-year yield fell below 0.10 percent for the first time since April last year, edging near its record low of around 0.05 percent touched almost a year ago.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to a five-week low of 1.715 percent, having fallen almost 0.3 percentage point from its March 16 peak of 2.002 percent.The two-year yield fell to a near six-week low of 0.716 percent while traders reduced bets on a Fed rate hike in June further.Oil offered the sole bright spot in financial markets with prices extending their rebound after Kuwait insisted major producers will agree to freeze output later this month even as key player Iran continued to balk at the plan.The market was also helped by data on US crude supply-demand for last week from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) showing a surprise fall of 4.3 million barrels in inventories in the week to April 1, versus an expected weekly increase of 3.2 million barrels.Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 1.6 percent to $38.48 per barrel, off one-month low of $37.27 hit on Tuesday.

If they keep falling in today's session, that is going to be really worrying,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.US stock futures slipped about 0.1 percent further in Asian trade after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen, said the US economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.Despite a chorus of comments from Fed policymakers about more rate hikes, many investors think the global economy is too weak to allow the Fed to raise rates all that fast.The 10-year US Treasuries yield fell to six-week low of 1.685 percent on Thursday, and was last trading at 1.7097. US interest rate futures maintained their firmness, pricing in a less than 20 percent chance of a rate hike in June.Lower yields undermined the dollar, given that prospects of higher US yields were the main attraction behind the currency's firmness.Investors instead bought back the yen which had been long under pressure due to the Bank of Japan's massive monetary easing.""Japan's move towards negative rates, amid a general inability to create substantial nominal GDP and therefore inflation, is now resulting in a wave of JPY buying,"" Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.Traders believe it would be hard for Japanese authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise after the Group of 20 agreement in February warned countries to refrain from competitive devaluation.Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday Japan will take necessary steps on currencies, but declined to comment on the issue of intervention.The yen strengthened to 107.67 to the dollar on Thursday, its highest since October 2014, and last stood at 108.64, heading for a weekly gain of 2.6 percent.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was up about 0.1 percent at 94.583, poised for a flat weekly performance.The euro also hit a six-month high of $1.1454 the previous day and last fetched $1.1361, set to end the week up 0.2 percent.On the other hand, commodity-linked currencies and many emerging economy currencies stepped back from recent multi-month highs as risk-averse mood took hold on investors.The Australian dollar traded at $0.7533, having fallen 1.3 percent on Thursday.In the commodities market, copper suffered its biggest fall in more than six months on Thursday, slumping 2.8 percent on the day and hitting a six-week low of $4,631 a tonne.China may be about to shock the global copper market by unleashing some of its stockpiles of the metal, which are near record highs, on to the global market.The metal was last trading at $4,660 a tonne.Oil prices rose on Friday after firm economic indicators from the US and Germany implied support for fuel demand, but analysts warned another downturn could be on the way due to ongoing oversupply.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 1.3 percent to $39.96 per barrel, set for an increase of 3.4 percent on the week.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 closed up $2.46, or 6.6 percent, to $39.72, up nearly 8 percent for the week.The Europe Oil and Gas index was up more than 3 percent while the S&amp;P energy index climbed 2 percent as the top-performing sectors in each region, tracking the rise in crude prices.""Clearly if you are looking at it from an index perspective, the stronger commodities are having a bit of a positive effect,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Chicago.""The market still remains very focussed on energy as kind of an indicator of economic health and credit risk that I don�t think has faded yet.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,576.96, the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.68 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,047.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.32 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,850.69.Even with Friday's modest gains, the S&amp;P 500 suffered its biggest weekly decline in two months.MSCI's index of world shares rose 0.68 percent but was down 0.55 percent for the week. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed up 1.2 percent, but still notched a fourth straight weekly decline, its longest losing streak since October 2014.Much of the volatility this week has been fuelled by the yen's surge against the dollar, which caught many market participants off-guard and increased speculation Tokyo could intervene in the currency market to halt the rally.The dollar briefly traded above 109.00 yen, recovering from its first break below 108.00 since October 2014 on Thursday. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government would take steps to counter ""one-sided"" moves in the yen in either direction.However, those gains faded late in the session and the dollar was last off 0.04 percent at 108.16 yen, for a weekly fall of 3.1 percent.Sharp appreciation of the safe-haven yen against the dollar is often a warning sign of broader financial market stress and investor risk aversion, which has been exacerbated this week by growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economic and policy outlook.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen on Thursday, said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The comments helped push benchmark 10-year Treasuries down 9/32 in price to yield 1.784 percent after they hit a low six-week of 1.685 percent on Thursday.",4/9/2016,,

It later pared some gains to trade up 0.8 percent at $1,249.70 an ounce by 0202 GMT, following its best weekly gain in five weeks last week.""Markets are still jittery about what's going on in the global economy... and gold is the preferred safe-haven,"" said OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan.Gold will remain elevated in the short term, Gan said, but he expected the metal to give back some of its gains later in the year as the Federal Reserve carried out two rate hikes.Higher rates would weigh on gold by lifting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.Waning expectations for further rate increases this year helped gold to its best quarter in nearly 30 years in the three months to March.Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes. The U.S. central bank raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The dollar slid 0.15 percent against a basket of major currencies, falling close to last week's low of 94.015, also the lowest since mid-October.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index fell nearly 2 percent.Data on Friday showed hedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions in gold futures and options in the week to April 5, but still not far from a two-month high.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.22 percent to 817.81 tonnes on Friday.",4/11/2016,,

""The port cranes are almost ready, and we are thinking that the port will be (at) full operation by the end of this year,"" said Zhang Baozhong, chairman and CEO of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd.The Chinese company took over Gwadar�s operations in 2013. The revamped port has three multipurpose berths and its inner is dredged to 11.5 metres. ""We�re expecting at least one million tons of material will go in and out"" next year, Zhang said, speaking at a day-long conference in Gwadar city.The projected traffic represents a 100 percent increase over this year�s throughput, but is a far cry from the 300-400 million tons per year that the Gwadar Port Authority envisions for the facility, which has ambitions of becoming a regional hub.Zhang acknowledged that Gwadar now had minuscule traffic - mostly Pakistani government-subsidised fertilizer imports - but he predicted a swift transformation in coming years.Part of the problem is that the new roads that CPEC is expected to build, linking the port to China�s industrial zones, have not yet come online and the Pakistani province of Baluchistan does not have enough export-ready products.""Even if you have a very good port, (if) you don�t have an inland transporting system and the economy in the near area is not very positive, the port will not be fully utilised,"" he said.He added that his company planned to develop seafood processing plants and other facilities in a 923 hectare free zone outside the port.

They will discuss measures to rein in ballooning oversupply which sees as many as 2 million barrels of crude produced every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold and unwanted fuel.Most analysts expect producers to freeze output around current output levels, which being beyond consumption and close to record levels would do little to address the glut.""The potential risk for prices is for the downside as freezing output at current levels would be more of a symbolic act rather than a real market intervention. But you need to be open to surprises in this market,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.While Spooner said that a production freeze would do little to address the immediate glut, he added that keeping key Middle East and Russian output around current levels might in the longer term lead to a more balanced market.""There is demand growth, and production in the U.S. is falling, so if against that background there was a freeze, markets could get tighter at some stage,"" he said.Analysts at Bernstein said that they expected global oil demand to grow at a mean annual rate of 1.4 percent between 2016 and 2020, versus annual growth of 1.1 percent over the past decade, adding that global demand would reach 101.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020 from 94.6 million bpd now.Looking further into the future, Bernstein said that world oil demand would likely peak in the 2030s.""The world will reach 'peak demand' before 'peak supply'.

business,IMF cuts global growth outlook agai,"strong>WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday of the risk of political isolationism, notably Britain's possible exit from the European Union, and the risk of growing economic inequality as it cut its global economic growth forecast for the fourth time in a year.</strongIn the run-up to the annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D.C. this week, the IMF said the global economy was vulnerable to shocks such as sharp currency devaluations and worsening geopolitical conflicts.In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast global economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, compared to a forecast of 3.4 percent in January. The growth estimate also was lowered in July and October of last year.For 2017, the IMF said the global economy would grow 3.5 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from its January estimate.Its latest report cited a worsening spillover from China's economic slowdown as well as the impact of low oil prices on emerging markets such as Brazil. It also highlighted persistent economic weakness in Japan, Europe and the United States.The gloomier picture sets the stage for the IMF and the World Bank to call this week for more coordinated global action to support growth.""In brief, lower growth means less room for error,"" IMF's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told a news conference, adding that ""scarring effects"" from years of tepid growth could in turn weaken demand, thin the workforce, and reduce potential output further, creating a scenario of ""secular stagnation.""strong>ISOLATIONISM GROWS</strongIn its report, the IMF warned that the rise of nationalist parties in Europe, the June 23 ""Brexit"" referendum, and anti-trade rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign posed threats to the global economic outlook.A British exit from the EU could do ""severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships,"" it said.""We're definitely facing the risk of going into doldrums that could be politically perilous,"" said Obstfeld, who pointed to stagnant wage growth as fueling a growing sense of economic inequality that is spilling into the voting booth in many countries.The IMF urged policymakers to boost growth with actions such as deregulating certain industries and raising labor market participation. It recommended nations with fiscal breathing room boost investments in infrastructure and cut labor taxes, and it encouraged central banks to keep monetary policy accommodative.The IMF's report and the gathering of officials and central bankers in Washington this week comes against the backdrop of widening rows in Europe over negative interest rates, a refugee crisis, and how to shore up Greece's financial bailout program.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the European Central Bank's record low interest rates were causing ""extraordinary problems"" for German banks and pensioners, and risked undermining voters' support for European integration.Official negotiations over Greece's bailout review have been idled during the IMF and World Bank meetings, but the debate over whether to provide more debt relief to Athens in exchange for further budget cuts is expected to continue on the sidelines.Obstfeld repeated the IMF's demand for a bailout program that would put Greece on a path to sustain its debt and begin growing again, adding that there should be some flexibility to help its government deal with the massive numbers of refugees who have fled to Greece from war-torn countries.strong>FORECASTS FOR JAPAN, U.S. ALSO CUT</strongThe IMF on Tuesday cut Japan's growth forecast for 2016 in half to 0.5 percent. It said Brazil's economy would now shrink by 3.8 percent this year versus the previous forecast of a 3.5 percent contraction, as Latin America's largest economy struggles through its deepest recession in decades.Meanwhile, the United States, one of the relative bright spots in the global economy, also saw its 2016 growth forecast cut to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent. The IMF said it anticipated an increased drag on U.S. exports from a stronger U.S. dollar, while low oil prices would keep energy investment weak.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will urge G20 and IMF members to take steps to bolster demand, but also to ""avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and refrain from targeting exchange rates for competitive purposes,"" a senior Treasury official told reporters.The IMF nudged China's growth forecast slightly higher to 6.5 percent this year, and 6.2 percent in 2017, partly due to previously announced policy stimulus moves. However, the Fund added that it was reducing its longer-term growth forecasts for China and said the Asian nation's ""momentous"" shift away from investment-led growth was continuing to chill global trade.",4/13/2016,,

""In the near term, we continue to expect a cyclical improvement as past stimulus measures are still filtering through to the economy.""The improving outlook for China�s economy has increased investor appetite for risky assets. An index tracking mainland investors� confidence in the<br/> stock market rose to 54.7 in March, up 12.1 percent from a month earlier, and exceeding 50 for the first time since December.A reading above 50 indicates optimism, while figures below 50 signals pessimism. The China market, which is under increasing pressure from profit-takers following a month-long rebound, also got some support from news that China�s central bank will inject 40 billion yuan ($6.18 billion) into the money markets on Thursday.Most sectors, including IT and consumer rose in both China and Hong Kong markets, but energy and resources shares dropped as investors took profit after<br/> Wednesday�s surge.",4/14/2016,,
business,Pakistan Customs proposes 5 to 20 percent duties on imported good,"strong>KARACHI: Pakistan Customs proposed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to impose five to 20 percent regulatory duties on a number of importable goods to avert the incidences of mis-declaration, which cause revenue losses to national exchequer.</strong�Various statutory rates of import duty, under the FTA (free trade agreement) regime provide opportunity to the importers to get items cleared under the minimum duty slab,� said the Customs Appraisement South, in its budget proposals for 2016/17. �It is, therefore, proposed that regulatory duty be enhanced to 15 percent from existing 10 percent on import of woven cotton fabric.��There are various rates of import duty on similar goods with only structural formation difference. Generally, the importers declare goods with vague and fake descriptions to claim the minimum duty slab.�It is proposed that regulatory duty be imposed on goods importable under lower duty slabs to rationalise the duty structure,� said the Customs Appraisement South.The department advised the FBR to specify same concessionary rate of sales tax on raw materials and goods imported by manufacturers/industrial consumers as well as commercial importers.���Commercial importers as well as industrial consumers should be given same rates of sales tax as it is difficult to check genuine manufacturers at import stage,� it said.According to a statutory regulatory order (1125(I)/2011), sales tax is charged at three percent on industrial inputs imported by manufacturers of the five export-oriented sectors. In case of commercial importers, value addition tax of three percent is also charged in addition to one percent sales tax at the import stage.�A majority of the commercial importers have managed to got themselves registered as �manufacturer� with a view to misuse the SRO, resulting in revenue loss,� the budget proposals document said.For example, it added that the balance of imports of textile yarn has abnormally shifted in favour of manufacturers from commercial importers.The Customs Appraisement South also proposed the FBR to withdraw duty and tax concessions available to the aviation industry.Presently, duty concessions are available on import of ground handling equipment, service and operation vehicles, catering equipment and fuel trucks, not manufactured locally and imported by domestic airlines or by any other service company to which a licence has been issued by the Civil Aviation Authority for such purposes.� The customs advocated the omission of these concessions, saying the private sector has entered into this field, and is earning substantial profit owing to the flourishing business.�Even no exemption is granted to this sector in the U.S. and other countries,� said the document.",4/15/2016,,

It shows the inability of all sides to cooperate,"" said Gary Ross, the founder and executive chairman at New York-based consultancy PIRA.The development will revive industry fears that major producers are embarking again on a battle for market share in a world already awash with unwanted oil, especially after Riyadh threatened to raise output steeply if no freeze deal were reached.As a result Brent would likely average $36 per barrel during the second quarter of this year as a global glut continued unabated, it said.""This meeting and its outcome should have built confidence that the oil market rebalancing was close at hand, as well as building a circle of trust among producers for possible future cooperation and coordinated action. In this regard, the meeting was a complete failure,"" Barclays added.""The failure of the talks gives the market another clear indication (similar to the failed December 2015 OPEC meeting) that OPEC's relevance in this market environment has faded, and its ability to coordinate with members outside the group is equally difficult.""Oil prices have fallen by as much as 70 percent since mid-2014 as producers have pumped 1 to 2 million barrels of crude every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel.Beyond the failed deal, however, there were signs of a tightening market due to an oil worker strike in Kuwait which may have cut its production from 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) to just 1.1 million bpd.In the United States, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday that drillers had cut their rigs to fresh 2009 lows as the industry suffers from low prices.",4/18/2016,,

A strike in Kuwait temporarily slashed the country's oil output by more than half, and helped pull crude prices off their lows.Brent crude was up about 0.1 percent at $42.97 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.5 percent to $39.96.""Oil started the day sharply lower after key producers failed to reach an agreement to freeze production but the losses were short lived as reports of a strike in Kuwait sparked a U-turn that briefly took prices into positive territory,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said in a note to clients.That helped commodity-linked currencies come roaring back to life after steep losses following the Doha deal breakdown.The Australian dollar was last up 0.4 percent at $0.7775 after earlier rising as high as $0.7778, its highest since June. On Monday, it had skidded as low as $0.7594.The perceived safe-haven yen slumped in line with the recovery in risk appetite. The dollar added 0.3 percent to 109.12 yen, while the euro added 0.3 percent to 123.35 yen, moving away from the previous session's three-year low.Against the dollar, the euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.1306, as investors looked ahead to the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. While no change is expected, investors are awaiting Mario Draghi's news conference for clues on the central bank's thinking.The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet next week, and is also expected to hold pat on policy, though any suggestion that more hikes are on the way sooner rather than later would lift the greenback.New York Fed President William Dudley said in a speech on Monday that economic conditions are ""mostly favorable"" yet the central bank remains cautious in raising interest rates because threats loom.For the second time in as many weeks, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren warned on Monday that futures markets, which see only one modest rate hike in each of the next few years, are off the mark.",4/19/2016,,

Australia's resource-sensitive index rose 0.8 percent to its loftiest level in almost four months.Japan's Nikkei climbed 1.1 percent as the yen retreated, bringing its rally to 10 percent in nine sessions.On Wall Street the Dow ended Tuesday with gains of 0.27 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.31 percent to close above 2100 for the first time in 2016.The Nasdaq eased 0.4 percent, while Intel shed 3 percent after hours as its results disappointed. The chipmaker lowered its revenue forest and said on Tuesday it would cut 12,000 jobs globally.Oil prices continued their recent see saw pattern, easing back in Asia after rising strongly on Tuesday. Brent crude lost 58 cents to $43.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude oil eased 73 cents to $40.35.Prices had gained as a strike in Kuwait cut production by 1.7 million barrels per day, partially offsetting the failure by oil producers to agree on an output freeze.Copper, iron ore, gold and silver all held hefty gains, with gold reaching $1,250.20 an ounce. That helped lift commodity currencies, and the Australian dollar notched a high not seen since June at $0.7827.Yet the US dollar still rallied on a weakening yen to reach 109.22, up from Monday's trough of 107.75.The euro edged up to $1.1358, from a low of $1.1234 set last week. Traders said much now depends on the outcome of the European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday.In March, ECB chief Mario Draghi unleashed an aggressive package but muted its impact by suggesting there would be no further cuts, giving the euro and unwelcome boost.""Outside of some verbal discomfort at the euro's strength and reiteration that the ECB stands ready to take further action if necessary, it is difficult to see what he can do,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note to clients.""The risks of a further squeeze higher in EUR/USD are significant,"" they added.",4/20/2016,,

With Brent up 8 percent since Monday and WTI 12 percent higher since April 18, this week is set for some of the steepest price rallies so far this year, and crude is up by more than two-thirds since its 2016 lows between January and February.Traders said that sentiment in the entire commodity complex had turned more confident, with new cash being put into the market by investors, lifting prices.Another factor has been producers taking advantage of higher prices by locking in production. ""We would expect producers in the U.S. taking every opportunity to aggressively hedge as soon as there is opportunity when oil prices recover for short periods of time,"" French investment bank Natixis said.Falling output, especially in the United States, where many producers are shutting down following an up to 70 percent price<br/>rout since 2014, is also helping to lift the market.Natixis said it expected U.S. oil production to drop by at least 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, compared with 2015, and by another 500,000 bpd in 2017.Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied as<br/>between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude are being pumped out of the ground every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel.",4/22/2016,,

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down around half a dollar, or 1.2 percent, at $43.22 a barrel.Analysts said the price drops were largely a result of cashing in after three weeks of rising prices. ""I guess (there�s been) some profit taking after a strong<br/>rally into the end of last week,"" said Virendra Chauhan of Energy Aspects in Singapore.Market data shows that the amount of open positions betting on rising WTI prices rose to levels last seen in June 2015 last week. At the same time, the amount of deals taken out in expectations of falling prices fell close to 2016 lows and levels prior last seen in the second quarter of last year.""If the selling pressure lasts through today, I suspect there�ll be a bit of a dent in the newest data when it gets released tomorrow,"" said one crude trader.A jump in the dollar on Friday against a basket of other leading currencies on expectations that Japan will further extend its aggressive monetary easing through negative interest rates, also dented oil.A stronger dollar, in which oil is traded, makes fuel imports for countries using other currencies more expensive, potentially hitting demand. Monday�s early oil price drops came despite another decline in the US rig-count that brings activity down for a fifth straight week and to levels last seen in November 2009.A total of 343 rigs were drilling for new oil last week.That compares to over 700 this time last year, according to oil services company Baker Hughes Inc on Friday.

It will invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2016 alone in such areas as environmental and safety technology, said Jochem Heizmann, who heads the German company's operations here.China is VW's most important market. With the government planning to adopt the world's toughest emissions regulations in 2017, the automaker intends to roll out 15 eco-car models over the next three to four years. It will begin full-scale production of a plug-in hybrid based on the Golf around 2018.Toyota Motor plans to build a plug-in-hybrid version of the Corolla starting that year. The company arranged the rollout schedule to coincide with a number of planned launches of plug-in hybrids by other automakers, said Hiroji Onishi, head of China operations.Honda Motor �will begin production of an Accord hybrid this July and release a plug-in hybrid in 2020. Market leader General Motors plans to spend 100 billion yuan ($15.3 billion) over the next five years to promote sales of electric and other vehicles.China led the world in new-car sales for a seventh straight year in 2015, at 24.59 million vehicles. Even if market growth slows, many still see plenty of room for expansion, given that the country has just over one car for every 10 people. Automakers are scrambling to roll out new models to take advantage of generous subsidies for eco-car purchases.But ""demand is strong now because of the tax break on compact cars that started last October,"" said Nobuhiko Watabe, an executive officer at Mazda Motor, adding that the true state of affairs is dire.

The more tame Fed tightening cycle, compared to expectations last year, should also support gold,"" Steel said.MKS Group trader Sam Laughlin said support around $1,230 should keep the metal buoyant, though gains will be limited by the Fed announcement on Wednesday.Speculation of further easing sent the yen reeling against the dollar late last week, but uncertainty over whether the BOJ will actually deliver fresh stimulus at its April 27-28 meeting saw the Japanese currency recover some ground.The Fed also holds a policy meeting this week, with the two-day gathering kicking off on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at the meeting, but markets will be looking for its take on the global economy and its monetary policy outlook.Economists expect the Fed to deliver a rate hike in June, and follow up with another by year-end. But interest rate futures show less conviction, underscoring an ongoing wide gap between markets and policymakers on the trajectory of rates.Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.3 percent to 802.65 tonnes on Monday, though remained not too far off a two-year high reached earlier this year.",4/26/2016,,

""That shows that something is not working.""Volkswagen plans to pay the 12 current and former members of its management board 63.24 million euros ($72.44 million) for 2015, a year when Europe's largest carmaker posted a record loss due to legal and compensation costs for cheating diesel emissions tests.The company withheld a small part of bonus payments but will award them at a later date if certain performance criteria are fulfilled, including a recovery of the Volkswagen's share price.The bonus payouts have sparked public outrage in Germany and a spat within Volkswagen's supervisory board.Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, had called for executive bonuses to be scrapped or cut as Europe's largest automaker counts the multi-billion-euro costs of ""Dieselgate"".Joerg Bode, a former supervisory board member who had represented Lower Saxony, told weekly Welt am Sonntag that ex-CEO Martin Winterkorn and his colleagues should pay back the part of the bonuses that had been generated by ""cost cuts through fraud"".Current supervisory board member Bernd Osterloh said last week that the carmaker should look beyond contractual obligations and that the management board should volunteer to cut their bonus payments. ""It is also about morals,"" he had said.Osterloh also said that the supervisory board should also discuss changes to its own remuneration system once the dieselgate scandal has been resolved.""As soon as business is back to normal we should think about changing the (remuneration) system (of the supervisory board),"" Osterloh was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying.A swift change to fixed salaries and abolishing variable pay components tied to dividends would be a wrong signal as that would effectively lead to a hike in remuneration, the Volkswagen labor chief told the paper.Following its record 2015 loss VW had slashed its dividend to 0.17 euros per preferred share from 4.86 euros.",5/1/2016,,

US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said.",5/2/2016,,

business,Pakistan succeeds in growing its apparel industry,"KARACHI: Pakistan has been successful in establishing and growing its apparel manufacturing industry, however, more can be done to realize its potential as a regional hub and to continue to boost opportunities, especially for women and the poor, according to a new World Bank report.The Stitches to Riches Apparel Employment Trade and Economic Development, launched in Pakistan today, is aimed at demystifying the global and South Asian apparel markets, estimating the potential gains in exports and jobs and identifying policies that can unleash country� s export and job potential compared with those of their closest competitors in the Southeast Asia region � Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.The report finds that it is important for South Asian economies to remove existing impediments and facilitate growth in apparel to capture more production and create more employment as wages rise in China.The successful manufacturers will be those who can supply a wide range of quality products to buyers rapidly and reliably,�not just those who offer low costs.China currently dominates global apparel trade but that may change in coming years due to the rising prices in China.Investors are compelled to seek out apparel firms in other countries. The potential decrease in Chinese exports presents a huge opportunity for South Asian countries.A 10 percent increase in Chinese apparel prices would increase apparel employment in Pakistan for males by 8.93 percent,�by far the biggest winner,�followed by Bangladesh 4.22 percent and India 3.32 percent.Women are also expected to benefit the most as their share in the total apparel employment is much higher than their share in other industries. This is true for Pakistan as well.The report finds that 1 percent increase in expected wages in Pakistan would raise the probability of women entering the labor force by 16.3 percent. Job creation is among the government�s top priorities.Apparel manufacturing presents the poor with job opportunities in Pakistan, especially for females, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.These employed women would in return spend more on the health and education of their children which will contribute towards the larger development goals of the country.Pakistan has a fast�growing apparel sector that accounts for 19 percent of its exports and firms are competitive with global exporters in terms of prices.Yet despite low prices in most apparel product categories, Pakistan lags competitors in reliability and policy continuation. It also remains highly concentrated in cotton products.South Asia has taken many steps in recent years to support the textile and apparel sector but it now needs to step up its game by tackling inefficiencies that are undercutting its competitiveness, says Gladys C Lopez�Acevedo, one of the authors of the report and a Lead Economist for the World Bank.Pakistan should use this opportunity and implement policies to become a regional leader in creating good jobs, bringing more women into the work force and diversifying its products and end markets to increase skills and value.The report suggests that Pakistan could benefit from the following policies.

business,Pakistan woos Renault and Nissan in push for auto inv,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is wooing foreign car makers like Renault and Nissan with generous import duties, but convincing them to set up factories will be an uphill challenge given fears about the country's long-term political stability and security.</strongPakistan wants to shake up its Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki, whose locally assembled cars are sold at relatively high prices but lag behind imported vehicles in terms of quality and specifications.To do that, analysts say, the government must convince manufacturers that the country has turned a corner after a decade of economic turbulence and a series of major attacks by militant groups including the Taliban.With the economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years, the local currency stable against the dollar and interest rates at their lowest in 42 years, Pakistani officials believe the country is once again on the radar of investors seeking to tap into a market of nearly 200 million people.Officials are touting a new auto policy, skewed in favour of new entrants, that includes offering foreign car manufacturers lower duties as an incentive to set up plants in Pakistan or revive shuttered ones.""We expect that there will be one or two foreign investors coming into Pakistan,"" said Miftah Ismail, chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, who has been talking to car makers about setting up assembly plants for the local market.Ismail told Reuters he had held talks with Japan's Nissan and France's Renault for ""some time"", and last month met Fiat executives in Italy for the first time.Previous discussions also involved Germany's Volkswagen.""I hope some people will bite,"" he said.A source close to Renault said Pakistan was under consideration for new production investment, along with other potential locations, but added that discussions were at a very early stage. In an e-mailed statement, the company said it had ""no news to announce at this time"".Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said: ""Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present"", but added no final decision had been made.strong>STABILITY</strongAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalising deals, despite the concessions on offer.A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability.The threat of militant attacks also remains high, despite the armed forces' long-running campaign against groups including the Taliban.Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long-term outlook is so uncertain.""There is potential in Pakistan. There is no doubt about that,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at consultant IHS Automotive. ""(But) we really don't feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition, from a mid to long-term perspective.""Another potential turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan's car market, where 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighbouring India.""The Pakistan market is not big enough,"" said Mumshad Ali, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts.He added that the government's new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers, nor did they address ways to increase demand, such as lowering sales taxes.The local manufacturing partners of Suzuki, Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.But Ali said they felt aggrieved that the government was favouring new investors and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing factories.Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free. Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at 10 percent, while existing players will have to pay 30 percent.""We want greater competition, and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices,"" he said.Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars, which tend not to have airbags, anti-lock breaking systems (ABS) and other features considered standard elsewhere.The cheapest Pakistani car, the Suzuki Mehran, sells for 650,000 Pakistani rupee ($6,200), or about double the price of a comparable model in India.""Local cars are so bad,"" said Ali Paracha, owner of a car rental company.

India also need to extend access to Pakistani products with preferential duty regime, the minister added.The minister also informed the delegation that the ministry has restructured National Tariff Commission (NTC) in line with the legal framework guided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Earlier, the delegation was of the view that Indian food manufactures are looking for different Pakistani agriculture products, like Mango and Kinno in specific seasons.Also they added Pakistan agriculture products, like green peas, can be exported to India as they run freezing plants at far less capacity of 200,000 tons.The business interlocutors were of the view that trade with both countries should cooperate in promoting SME, Agriculture, Tourism, Culture, Research sectors Basmati Rice, branding issue and exchange of business groups� visits.Later, a delegation of Pakistan Commercial Exporters Association called on Minister for Commerce with an agenda to boost exports in Gems and Jewelry products.Assuring full support to the business group, the minister said government shall move further ahead in increasing exports and soliciting resources until exports fraternity come forward and take initiatives and mobilize their resources.",5/10/2016,,

Experts say the economy needs to expand by at least 6 percent a year to absorb new entrants to the work force.Illango Patchamuthu, the World Bank country director, said Pakistan had benefited from a collapse in global oil prices and tough fiscal measures by the government over the past few years to stabilise the economy.But he urged faster reform in the energy sector, which has suffered decades of under-investment. Businesses say frequent power outages hurt growth and investment.""To me, the whole story around power reforms is still only half done,"" Patchamuthu told Reuters in an interview.He said Pakistan must tackle its so-called circular debt problem, which stems from unpaid government subsidies that build up until power plant owners cannot afford fuel. It stands at about $3 billion.The government expects its electricity rationing system of ""load-shedding"" to end by 2018 after it signed more than $30 billion in energy generation projects as part of the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Project.But efforts to privatise a host of electricity distribution companies have stalled, as have other reforms.Patchamuthu said the government has been focused on power generation, but it must also seek to improve distribution and upgrade ancient transmission systems.""A lot more needs to be done in the next several years to build up the whole power infrastructure,"" he said.Patchamuthu said another way for Pakistan to significantly boost growth is reforming its male-dominated labour market, where women account for only 22 percent of the workforce.""If Pakistan wants to get to 7-8 percent (growth) with structural reforms, they also have to much more in drawing women into the labour force,"" he said.""There are social and cultural challenges,"" Patchamuthu said.

business,dollar dominance global currency,"strong>LONDON: The world is getting an object lesson on the problems of having one dominant global currency and even the supposed prime beneficiary, the United States, can see the downside.</strongAlarming bouts of volatility in world financial markets over the past 12 months have been rooted in a fear of what happens when a world with its highest-ever peacetime debt pile faces even a hint of higher interest rates.Despite a constant narrative about U.S. households and banks paying down debts ever since the global credit crash eight years ago, any 'deleveraging' that did happen was more than offset by higher government, corporate and personal debt around the globe in Europe, China and across emerging markets.In fact, aggregate world debt is now far higher than it was before the 2007-08 crash.""The saga of debt is far from over,"" says a report from Morgan Stanley. It goes on to explain why Morgan Stanley expects demographic-led shifts in savings and investment to soon push interest rates higher and transform that debt mountain into additional deadweight on world growth over next five years.But the role of the U.S. dollar as the world's main reserve currency denominating large chunks of that debt pile is showing up as complicating factor that's added to risk of instability.The first U.S. interest rate increase in almost a decade in December - just a quarter of a percentage point - was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since World War Two.Underlining 'cause and effect', the subsequent recovery only came about once the Federal Reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance.Few doubt a growing U.S. economy that's near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero, and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that.But the rest of the world clearly can't.The Bank for International Settlements estimates that while U.S. dollar dominance means it accounts for almost 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some 60 percent of hard currency reserves. But crucially it also accounts for about 60 percent of all debts and assets outside the United States.And if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts, the boomerang effect on U.S. exporters, commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the Fed's hands in ways made crystal clear this year already.strong>AMBIVALENCE</strongNo surprise, then, the U.S. central bank has no deep love for the dollar's prime reserve currency status - even though it's been described by Europeans and others over the years as an ""exorbitant privilege"" that ensures the world lends to the U.S. Treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength.Speaking at an event in Zurich on Tuesday on the dollar's global status, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley said Americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or China's yuan eventually eat into the dollar's share of reserves.""If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses,"" he said, as long as it ""is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job.""While that's far from wishing away dollar hegemony, it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs - given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy.It's that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere.If the Fed can't adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self-defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar, then there's understandable concern that artificially low Fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that's supposed to play anchor.At the same event in Zurich, Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic Department of the BIS, said the dollar's role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the United States to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits - and to run looser monetary policy for longer.What's more, a resulting Fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons, Borio added.""Easing begets easing,"" he said.For Morgan Stanley, this is just leads to ever-higher debt, and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years - only a series of ""less painful"" options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual.In the meantime, the U.S. bank said, the dollar itself will most likely push higher again, if only because the U.S. economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment.For Borio, a more 'pluralistic' system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn't by itself solve any problem, either. There would then be no credible single anchor.Hard-headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer.""This means not just putting one's house in order, but also putting our global village in order.""",5/11/2016,,

Brent's gain was its biggest one-day percentage move in a month.The market pared gains briefly in post-settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, said U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.45 million barrels to record highs of 543.1 million during the week ended May 6.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a build of only 714,000-barrels.Traders and investors will be looking out for official inventory data on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""We should roll back a good part of today's gains if the EIA confirms the builds cited by API or comes up with even larger numbers,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.Brent LCOc1 settled up $1.89, or 4.3 percent, at $45.52 per barrel. More than 6,000 contracts changed hands in the final minute, Reuters data showed. The global oil benchmark rose to as high as $45.70 in post-settlement trading. After settlement, it briefly dipped more than 30 cents on the API data, then recovered to near its settlement price.U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 rose 1.22, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $44.66. WTI also fell briefly on the API data.Refined oil products joined the rally, with gasoline RBc1 closing up 3 percent and ultralow sulphur diesel HOc1, or heating oil, 4 percent.Oil prices were up most of the day on worries about supply outages.Wildfires in Canada have shut in more than 1 million barrels per day of production from Alberta's oil sands region.

business,Say goodbye to OPEC powerful Putin pal predi,"strong>MOSCOW: Internal differences are killing OPEC and its ability to influence the markets has all but evaporated, top Russian oil executive Igor Sechin told Reuters in some of his harshest remarks ever about the oil cartel.</strongRussia, which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse, was flirting with the idea of cooperating with OPEC in recent months until tensions between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran ruined a global deal to freeze output.Sechin - one of the closest allies of President Vladimir Putin - was the only Russian official to consistently oppose the deal with OPEC even after the Kremlin effectively endorsed the plan.Now that his gloomy predictions about talking to OPEC have come to pass, Sechin feels vindicated and wants to help Russia avoid similar embarrassment in future.""At the moment a number of objective factors exclude the possibility for any cartels to dictate their will to the market. ... As for OPEC, it has practically stopped existing as a united organization.""""The company (Rosneft) was skeptical from the very beginning about the possibility of reaching any sort of joint agreement with OPEC's involvement in current conditions,"" said Sechin, in comments over the weekend which were embargoed until Tuesday.""Just to remind you, the only one question with which we responded to those who were interested to know our position: 'Who should we agree with, and how?' The development of the situation has clearly shown we were right.""Sechin's comments about the end of the era when OPEC could influence prices chime with those of Saudi Arabia's newly appointed energy minister Khaled al-Falih.Falih, who took over on Saturday from long-serving Ali al-Naimi, has been very vocal in the past year about his views that the oil market needs to rebalance through low prices and that the Saudis have the resources to wait.Falih's ultimate boss, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees Saudi oil policies, has also signaled that the world is moving to a new era where supply and demand rather than OPEC will determine prices.Sechin, who was born in 1960 - the same year as Falih - is also calling on Russia to abandon any hope that prices can be fixed by anything other than market rebalancing.""At the moment, key factors which are influencing the market are finance, technology and regulation. We can see this with the example of shale oil which ... became a powerful tool of influence on the global market,"" Sechin said in the emailed comments.",5/11/2016,,

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 38 cents or 0.8 percent at $45.85.Traders said the dips were largely a result of profit taking following intra-day Brent price rises of up to $2.95 the previous day.""A lot of people think that yesterday's jump was a bit over the top, so they've taken the profit while they could this morning,"" said one oil trader.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell 3.4 million barrels to 540 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 714,000 barrels and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) reported build of 3.5 million barrels in preliminary data issued on Tuesday.The surprise draw in crude inventories was offset on Thursday by an expected increase in Canadian oil sand crude production following disruptions to over 1 million barrels of daily production capacity due to wildfire.""We were not totally surprised with the draw after the shut-in in Canadian production,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.",5/12/2016,,
business,India trademark patent policy global pressur,"strong>NEW DELHI: India announced a new intellectual property policy on Friday, speeding up the online registration of patents and trademarks, but resisted pressure from the United States and other Western countries to amend its patent laws.</strongThe policy will make the Department of Industrial Promotion and Policy the agency in charge of regulating intellectual property rights in the country.Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014, global drug brands led by U.S. companies have been pushing for changes to India's intellectual property rules.India's strained patent and intellectual property administration has failed to keep pace with growing technological advances. Global pharmaceuticals players have often complained about India's price controls and marketing restrictions.""We hope it will lead to an interpretation of the Indian Patent Act that respects innovation, encourages research and facilitates effective enforcement mechanisms,"" said Ranjana Smetacek, Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, a body of multinational drugmakers in India.Nirmala Sitharaman, commerce and industry minister, told lawmakers last month that over 237,000 applications were pending in India's four patent offices.The policy aims to spread awareness among public about trademarks, copyrights and patents to promote innovation within the country, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters.The new policy will try to safeguard the interests of rights owners with the wider public interest, while combating infringements of intellectual property rights.Jaitley said India would retain the right to issue so-called compulsory licenses to its drug firms, under ""emergency"" conditions, and would not immediately need to change patent laws that were already fully World Trade Organization-compliant.""Compulsory licences are already provided in our patent law. That existing provision will continue,"" Jaitley said after the cabinet approved national IPR policy on Thursday evening.Last month, the U.S. Trade Representative kept India, China and Russia on its ""Priority Watch List"" for inadequate improvement in IPR protection.

business,Italy violin makers struggle profitab,"strong>CREMONA: Making violins is a passion in Cremona, the ancient Italian town that has been producing them since the 16th century, but turning passion into profits has not been easy.</strongCremona, in northern Italy, has more than 100 workshops making violins and other stringed instruments for musicians worldwide, following in the tradition of its great violin-makers which have included Antonio Stradivari and Nicol� Amati.Many of the town's ""liutaia"" specialize exclusively in master instruments in the tradition of Stradivari, each taking months to produce and costing around 20,000 Euros each. Some liutaia make as few as six or seven violins a year.Edgar Russ, an Austrian who came to Cremona in 1984, says it is tough to make a living by crafting only master instruments and that the town's violin-makers need to change.""At the end of the day, you work for free,"" he says.Russ offers various levels of craftsmanship, a model he says does not sit well with Cremona's traditionalists. But he believes it is a way of prospering and ensuring it remains a thriving center of violin-making in the long-term.His workshop makes violins for beginners as well as his ""Linea Macchi"" line for professionals who cannot afford a master violin. He also makes a handful of master instruments each year.Only the masters are made by his hands alone.""The real energy comes from the passion for this kind of work. It makes me happy to create something which does not have any straight lines. Even if you don't play, you love to hold it in your hand. It's beautiful to look at; it shows all your personality and your ability and your craftsmanship.""And it makes a beautiful sound.""",5/13/2016,,
business,Comic books teach fi,"strong>NEW YORK: It's a bird, it's a plane, and it�s a ... financial planner? The next time your kid brings home a comic book, it might not be just about battles, explosions and good versus evil. Instead, it might be about evaluating wants versus needs, living within your means and creating emergency funds.</strongThat is because financial services company Visa Inc has partnered with Marvel Comics to create ""Rocket's Powerful Plan,"" a new comic book starring the superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy. The comic is slated to be sent to every public library in the United States, and there are more than 150,000 copies printed in eight languages.The theme: why it makes sense to cultivate money smarts.""The challenge was to create a fun, action-packed story while also including a lesson on personal finance,"" said Darren Sanchez, an editor at Marvel. ""Trying to squeeze educational information into a story can be tough, especially with a topic like money management. To make it work you have to be careful not to overwhelm the story.""After all, as any parent knows, children listen to very little of what you have to say, especially when it comes to money. When it is the Guardians of the Galaxy who are talking (Rocket, Groot, Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax the Destroyer), they are more likely to actually pay attention.So who is the Suze Orman of the superhero world, dispensing personal finance advice while defeating powerful foes at the same time? Turns out it is Rocket, an intelligent raccoon, who is voiced by Bradley Cooper in the recent big-screen film.When the squad receives a fee for exterminating robopests, Rocket suggests putting some of that money aside for an emergency fund. That cash later comes in handy when the group has to repair their spaceship, and purchase high-tech weapons to vanquish their enemies. (Sorry about the spoilers.)The comic is the second such venture by Visa. The original, produced in 2012, featured the Avengers and Spider-Man tossing off money advice. It proved to be so popular with educators that more than half a million copies were eventually printed.This time, in addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy, look for cameos by Ant-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk. It was produced in languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese and Malay.""We wanted simple messages that kids could latch on to and take out of it, like saving for a rainy day,"" said Hugh Norton, Visa's head of financial education. ""Issues like emergency savings are extremely important, and something we can drill into kids from an early age.""On the back of the comic book, kids will find interactive games like word searches, where they can try to locate terms like ""budget,"" ""currency"" and ""goal,"" for example.There is also a wants-versus-needs challenge. Should you spend money on necessities like ""water"" and ""a place to live,"" or luxuries like ""video games"" and ""candy""? (On second thought, kids, do not answer that.)Judging from a recent survey, it seems like parents could indeed use all the help they can get in explaining money topics to kids.ALMOST AS 'BAD' AS DEATH AND SEXIn the annual ""Parents, Kids &amp; Money"" survey by Baltimore-based money managers T. Rowe Price Group Inc, more than half of parents admitted they were ""somewhat,"" ""very"" or ""extremely"" reluctant to talk about financial issues with their children. The only subjects they were more reluctant to talk about? Death and sex.And 44 percent have not talked to their kids at all about financial subjects including long-term investing, market volatility, or financial statements.That is where a money-oriented comic book like ""Rocket's Powerful Plan"" could come in handy. In the past Visa has tried out other innovative avenues to reach out to kids, as well, such as sponsoring financial literacy-themed National Football League games.Marvel has put its deep bench of superheroes to work on other custom projects, as well, including for Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co's Disney Interactive, ESPN and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.Even superheroes are not immune from the financial challenges of parenthood, by the way. In Visa and Marvel's new comic, when Ant-Man gets a cut of the fee from the Guardians of the Galaxy for helping eliminate their enemies, what does that cash go toward?Purchasing a drum set for his daughter.",5/13/2016,,

In the April 14 letter Thomas Baxter, general counsel and executive vice president at the New York Fed, said the correct procedures were followed in approving five transfers of money on<br/>Feb.4 and in blocking 30.Baxter said the New York Fed�s procedures for checking transfers included catching those to people subject to sanctions<br/>but would not stop a transfer if it had passed the authentication process on the SWIFT messaging network.""The vast majority of authenticated instructions received from foreign official account holders are not flagged for manual review by the automated systems,"" Baxter wrote in the letter.Authorities in Bangladesh and elsewhere are still trying to figure out how hackers carried out the attack and what happened to the money, which was routed from the Bangladesh Bank�s account at the New York Fed to accounts in the Philippines.Maloney said in a statement on Friday that while Baxter�s letter provided key information about the incident, she remained<br/>""concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system.""Maloney said she would urge the New York Fed to review its security protocols to make sure such a heist does not recur.",5/14/2016,,

This means banks cannot use the dollar for any deals with Iran, while U.S. banks are barred from doing business outright.While the U.S. embargo does not in theory prevent non-U.S. banks from dealing with Iran, in reality many remain hesitant to do so because they faced hefty fines in the past and are wary of the U.S. sanctions that remain in place.",5/15/2016,,

Only unusually smooth talks between Athens and its lenders may keep Greece off the agenda this time around.The hosts' monetary and fiscal policy trajectory appears obvious: the Bank of Japan is coming under increasing pressure to counter a damaging rise in the value of the yen that could derail a fragile recovery for the world's third-largest economy.Talk of more action gathered pace after an academic seen to be close to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ is likely to expand monetary stimulus either in June or July. The government has also said Tokyo is ready to intervene in currency markets.Whether explicitly on the agenda or not, such interventions are certain to be brought up by counterparts from France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Canada and the United States either side of a planned field trip to see how the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai has recovered from the devastating 2011 earthquake.On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe beat the drum for a broader fiscal stimulus, saying most G7 leaders agreed it was necessary as a means of boosting global demand, though getting all of them to enact the same policy steps would be tough.First-quarter Japanese economic output data on Wednesday - following on from more signs of slowing growth in China - should flesh out the downbeat picture with quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to have expanded just 0.1 percent, according to a Reuters poll.""The Bank of Japan has been heavily criticized for its decision not to take further economic stimulus measures at its meeting in April,"" said Commerzbank economist Bernd Weidensteiner.""Because of its refusal to bow to the market expectations of 'more and more', the central bank currently faces a tough task to convince the markets of its policy actions.""FED PUZZLEThings are not so straightforward for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is caught in a bind over when to push interest rates higher amid concerns about the health of the labor market at home and fears about the knock-on effects its actions will have abroad.�There was fresh hesitation among economists ahead of the release in the coming week of the minutes from the April 26/27 Fed meeting when the central bank's rate-setting committee acknowledged that economic growth seemed to have slowed.The Fed will likely wait until September before raising rates again, a Reuters poll found this week, stretching to nine months the time since its first hike in nearly a decade as it waits for clear signs inflation is picking up.April's U.S. inflation figures arrive on Tuesday, a day before the euro zone give an update on its battle to register any kind of price growth and the same day Britain releases its consumer price data for last month.British price growth is expected to have slowed after a pick up in March while jobless numbers on Wednesday may also show a dip in hiring in the first quarter as employers turn cautious ahead of June's Brexit vote.

business,Oil futures hold near six month hig,"strong>TOKYO: Crude oil futures held near six-month highs in early Asian trading as the market focused on supply disruptions that prompted long-time bear Goldman Sachs to issue a bullish assessment on near-term prices.</strongCrude futures have rallied for most of the past two weeks from a combination of Nigerian, Venezuelan and other outages, declining U.S. production and virtually frozen inflows of Canadian crude after wildfires in Alberta's oil sands region.U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 8 cents at $47.80 a barrel at 0047 GMT. They rose by $1.51, or 3.3 percent, to end at $47.72 after touching a six-month high on Monday.Brent crude futures were down 5 cents at $48.92 a barrel after rising slightly following the opening of trade.

business,Unusual heat bakes Sri Lanka chicken industry,"strong>COLOMBO: As noon-time temperatures began soaring in late March, Mohamed Nizam, a small-scale chicken seller, knew he was headed for trouble.</strongSoon the mid-day heat was touching 40 degrees Celsius, and Nizam told his workers to pour water on to the pavement in front of his shop in the Colombo suburb of Wattala in an effort to ward off the heat.""But nothing can keep that kind of heat from getting to the chickens. It roasts them alive,"" Nizam said.Across Sri Lanka, small- and medium-scale chicken producers � often with between 1,000 and 25,000 birds � are struggling to keep their birds alive in the face of temperatures 2 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius above normal over the last two months.Many of the birds live in tightly packed pens, where the heat makes them dehydrated. Larger industrial operations use fans and spray water on them, but smaller operations cannot afford such investments.�Usually when the heat is high, we use ice or water to keep the pens cool. This time they were no match for the heat. I lost half of my stock,� said Rumi Jamaldean, who runs a farm with around 8,000 birds in the Kurunegala District, about 120 kilometres from Colombo.strong>RISING PRICES</strongThe losses have translated into big hikes in chicken prices. In Colombo and its suburbs a kilo of fresh chicken was selling for 620 rupees (around $5.50) during the first week of May. Two months earlier it was Rs 450 and a year ago Rs 400.�My sales have dropped,� Nizam said, estimating they had fallen by 40 percent. �People can�t afford it. The prices are way too much,� he said.With chicken by far the most popular meat in this largely Buddhist nation that shuns many other types of meat, the price hike is likely to have an impact on nutrition. On average a Sri Lankan eats seven times as much chicken per year as beef, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.The nation�s poultry industry produces about 165,000 metric tons of meat a year, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.Sri Lankan chicken farmers have long experience with warm months and often use homegrown methods to keep their birds cool, including ice, water, fans or sometimes feeding the birds sodium-bicarbonate, which growers say can help prevent dehydration.But �this time the heat was too much and nothing could have prevented such losses�, said Nimal Jayaratne, head of the Department of Animal Production and Health.According to the Meteorological Department, during the fourth week of April the Northern Vavuniya District recorded an average daily temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. During the same time period, rain fall was below average.�It has been extremely warm, warmer than any other time in the past five years,� said Lal Chandrapala, director general of the Meteorological Department.Experts and farmers agree that Sri Lanka�s small-scale chicken farmers are not ready to deal with such extreme heat.�If you look at the pens, they are just brick sheds with corrugated tin sheets on the roof. During times when the weather is okay, they can work. But when the heat comes, there is hardly any room for ventilation and there is no money to invest to save the stock,� Jayaratne said.Chicken farmer Jamaldean said he will absorb the losses as much as he can, pass some portion of it to his customers, and just wait until the heat passes, with cooler monsoon weather due late this month or in early June.But �chicken prices will not come down soon. It will take at least two months,� warned Nizam.",5/18/2016,,

business,IMF backs Saudi economic ,"strong>DUBAI: The International Monetary Fund backed Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform plan on Thursday and said the kingdom was cutting spending at the right speed to cope with a huge state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.</strongLate last month, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced steps to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil exports over the next 15 years, including subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment.The IMF had for years been urging Saudi Arabia to adopt many of those measures, and in a statement on Thursday it said the reform plan aimed for ""an appropriately bold and far-reaching transformation of the Saudi Arabian economy"".""The supporting policies that will be announced in the coming months are expected to set out how these goals will be achieved,"" IMF official Tim Callen said after leading a team to Saudi Arabia this month for annual consultations with the Fund.""To ensure their success, the reforms will need to be properly prioritized and sequenced, and the appropriate pace of implementation carefully assessed.""Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totaled $98 billion in 2015. The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.But it welcomed the government's spending controls and changes to domestic energy prices announced last December, saying: ""Fiscal policy is appropriately adjusting to the drop in oil prices."" The economy is expected to grow 1.2 percent this year, slowing from 3.5 percent in 2015, the Fund said.strong>DEFICIT FINANCING</strongThe IMF also said it approved of the way in which the government was financing its deficit with a combination of drawing down its financial reserves and issuing debt at home and abroad.The Fund has been encouraging some North African states to make their foreign exchange rates more flexible to cope with big current account deficits. But it took the opposite tack toward the external deficit which Saudi Arabia is running because of cheap oil, saying the riyal's peg to the U.S. dollar was continuing to serve the economy well.Market interest rates in Saudi Arabia have been rising sharply as the government borrows from banks to finance its deficit, with the three-month Saudi interbank offered rate SASAR3MD= jumping 135 basis points since mid-2015 to a multi-year high of 2.13 percent.But the IMF said the Saudi banking sector was strong and well-positioned to weather a slowing economy, and that tightening liquidity was not yet hurting credit growth.Two cornerstones of the Saudi reform plan are the sale of a stake of up to 5 percent in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, which could fetch tens of billions of dollars, and a build-up of the government's Public Investment Fund into a global investment vehicle.The IMF urged Riyadh to make both institutions more transparent and to integrate them into a new fiscal policy apparatus which the government is creating to make spending decisions more efficient.",5/19/2016,,

Food prices are a political hot potato in India, where more than a quarter of their populations of 1.2 billion people live on a mere 74 cents or less per day.India is struggling with the first back-to-back drought in nearly three decades, which has ravaged crops, but expected good rains in the June-September monsoon season may boost production and food supplies later in the year.Indian farmers usually start sowing summer crops from June onwards and harvesting starts in October.""Good monsoon rainfall can lead to higher production, but new crops will be available for consumption only after few months,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives and Commodities.""Until we get the new crop, prices will remain elevated due to limited supplies.""Already the price of chickpea, the most consumed pulse in India, has risen over a quarter in a year, while sugar prices jumped 35 percent. Potato prices have doubled.Prices are likely to rise further as demand grows in coming months due to festivals like Ramadan, said Ashwini Bansod, a senior analyst at Phillip Commodities India Pvt Ltd.Rising prices could make it difficult for Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to again cut interest rates.A fall in inflation to within targeted levels earlier this year allowed Rajan in April to cut rates to a more than five-year low.""With core inflation also sticky, headline inflation is therefore likely to stay at 5 percent or higher which makes it difficult for further rate cuts by the RBI,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.Despite higher prices, farmers have been unable to cultivate vegetables due to higher temperatures and water scarcity.Water levels in the country's 91 major reservoirs have depleted to 19 percent of capacity as of May 12, compared to 31 percent a year ago.Many state governments like the western state of Maharashtra have cut water supplies for agriculture and reserved it for drinking purpose.""Every year in summer I cultivate vegetables.

But the Nikkei later pared its gains to just 0.2 percent.The Fed minutes noted Fed officials said it would be appropriate to raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment.Such views helped revive the prospect of a rate hike in June, which had been dismissed by many investors.CME fed fund futures showed that the probability of a June rate increase by the Fed rose to 34 percent after the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday from 19 percent earlier in the day, 15 percent on Tuesday, and less than 1.0 percent a month ago, according to CME group's FedWatch.Still, many in the market are still skeptical the Fed would raise rates ahead of Britain's June 23 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union, a risk that was pointed out by some Fed policymakers. July may be a stronger possibility.The dollar index hovered just below a seven-week high of 95.27 scaled overnight, boosted by sharply higher U.S. Treasury yields.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield jumped more than 10 basis points on Wednesday while the yield curve steepened slightly, breaking a multi-month streak of flattening.The greenback was steady at a three-week high of 110.25 against the yen hit overnight.

""GDP growth in FY16 is expected to provide the needed sustainability in growth trajectory and the basis for further improvement in FY17,"" the bank said in a statement.It added that foreign exchange reserves are expected to continue building, while the current account deficit will be at around 1 percent of GDP.Potential headwinds for the economy may come from an increase in global oil prices, the bank said.Pakistan is a net importer of oil.",5/21/2016,,
business,India pays Iran oil dues Modi visi,"strong>NEW DELHI: Indian refiners have cleared part of the $6.4 billion owed to Iran for crude oil imports in euros through Turkey's Halkbank, three sources privy to the payment said on Saturday.</strongThis is the first payment to Iran by India since the lifting of Western sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation earlier this year and comes just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit beginning on Sunday.State refiner Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd paid $500 million while Indian Oil Corp has settled $250 million through the Union Bank of India, the sources said.The refiners had been holding back 55 percent of the oil payments to Iran after the route to make payments through Halkbank was stopped in 2013, although payment of some of those funds was allowed after an initial temporary deal to lift the sanctions.It is not yet known when the second instalment will be paid, the sources said.India is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude, and is set to import at least 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iran in the year from April 1. But it built up a backlog of payments when Iran was under sanctions.Modi is making a first trip to Iran since he took office in 2016, aimed at deepening energy ties. During the visit, India will sign a contract to build and operate the port of Chabahar on the southern Iranian coast that is aimed at boosting connectivity with Afghanistan and central Asia.",5/21/2016,,
business,IMF researchers say Japan monetary easing has benefits for Asian economi,"WASHINGTON: Japan�s extraordinarily easy monetary policy, a source of friction with the United States for pushing the yen�s value down, has had some positive effects on emerging Asian economies, including increased growth and equity prices, International Monetary Fund researchers have found.The IMF findings were released in a paper on Friday, as Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in Japan, where divergent views on Japan�s monetary policy and currency market interventions were expected to be a hot topic.The paper claims to be the first to model the spillover effects of Japan�s qualitative and quantitative easing program (QQE) on Southeast Asian countries.QQE was launched in 2013 and targets both government bond purchases as well as other assets, such as exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.The program has helped push down the yen from 82 to the dollar in 2012 to 119 to the dollar by August 2015. Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said. ""Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan, when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices, consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries, as well as an appreciation of their currencies,"" they wrote.""Most (Southeast Asian) countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation. Capital inflows surged in many countries.""They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japan�s QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a ""generally positive"" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in<br/> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.",5/21/2016,,
business,Abu Dhabi lays off staff Gulf austerity tig,"strong>ABU DHABI: Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulf�s wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies.</strongSince mid-2015, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries in the region have curbed spending on some construction projects and reduced energy subsidies to limit budget deficits caused by cheap oil.Now some governments are also starting to reduce staff at the companies they control, many of them in the energy industry, in order to ensure the firms are not a drain on state finances if oil prices stay low for several years.Abu Dhabi�s National Oil Co (ADNOC), with around 55,000 staff, has cut hundreds of jobs in the last few months and will have reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 by the end of 2016, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The reduction will occur across most of its 17 subsidiaries as part of a restructuring following a reshuffle of the firm�s leadership this month, they said.An ADNOC spokesman did not confirm or deny the cuts but said: ""In keeping with the entire oil and gas industry, ADNOC is constantly looking at ways to be more efficient and more profitable, particularly in the current market environment.""The UAE�s oil and gas recruitment market is set for its most difficult year in over a decade in 2016, a report from recruiters Morgan McKinley said.""The oil and gas industry is still feeling the pain, as was to be expected. Overall redundancies have been on the increase,"" said Trefor Murphy, managing director for the region.Most layoffs at Abu Dhabi state firms are not in response to production cut-backs; the UAE has not reduced its oil output, and says it is proceeding with long-planned oil and gas development projects.Nor do the layoffs mean Abu Dhabi is running out of money.With hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund, the emirate could draw down its reserves to sustain current levels of spending for decades.But the government wants to minimise the speed of the draw-down as it looks ahead to the possibility of many years of low oil prices.Last year, Abu Dhabi acted ahead of other Gulf States in cutting domestic fuel and electricity subsidies.Now it is applying the same approach to state-linked firms.In Qatar, state-controlled firms such as Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Rail have been laying off staff.State companies in other states such as Saudi Arabia and Oman have been looking at ways to reduce costs but have so far not resorted to major job cuts.strong>CUTS</strongMost cuts at state firms in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere involve foreign staff rather than locals, because governments want to limit unemployment among their citizens.Nevertheless, the job losses are contributing to an economic slowdown in the region.The International Monetary Fund has predicted Abu Dhabi�s gross domestic product growth will fall to 1.7 percent this year from 4.4 percent in 2015.In neighbouring Dubai, where the economy is not directly reliant on oil and state-linked firms are vigorously pushing tourism and real estate projects, growth is forecast to accelerate marginally, to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent.Companies cutting staff in Abu Dhabi include Abu Dhabi National Energy Co, which has reduced its workforce by a quarter since 2014. It has cut around a third of oil and gas jobs and 55 percent of staff at its headquarters, it said this month after reporting a first-quarter loss.Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Rail, the federal government-owned entity building a UAE rail network, said it cut 30 percent of its staff in a restructuring.Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority laid off scores of people, mostly expatriates, sources said.Spokespeople for the authority did not return calls seeking comment.National Petroleum Construction Co, owned by Abu Dhabi�s state-owned industrial conglomerate Senaat and one of the largest oilfield contractors in Abu Dhabi, is reviewing its manpower levels, chief executive Aqeel Madhi told Reuters.Construction firm Arabtec, in which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments is the biggest shareholder, may include job cuts in its cost reduction programme, chairman Mohamed al-Rumaithi said last month, adding: ""There�s some fat to be taken out.""Some firms are axing expatriates to create jobs for UAE nationals.Medical centre operator Cleveland Clinic, owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, is creating over 100 positions for locals, having told some expatriate staff they have to leave by year-end, sources said.Asked to comment, Cleveland said that as part of its efforts to develop local talent, a number of administrative roles would move to UAE citizens in coming months.",5/22/2016,,

And we all know where that ends up: higher prices in the shops,"" Cameron wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper.The warning comes from a government analysis of the short-term impact that a British exit would have on voters.He said the average family's weekly food and drink bill would rise by almost 3 percent, or 120 pounds ($174.06) per year, and that clothing and footwear costs would rise by 5 percent, or 100 pounds per year.The 'rival 'Out' campaign disputed the analysis. ""The EU pushes up the prices in our supermarkets because of its protectionist policies. That's ok for big business fat cats but it's not good for British families,' said Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott.Six out of the last seven polls published in the last week have shown the Remain campaign in the lead, and on Saturday two major bookmakers offered the shortest odds to date on a vote to remain.On Friday Osborne warned, citing the same Treasury analysis, said house prices would fall if Britain left the EU.

business,India soybean falling farmers switch pu,"strong>MUMBAI: Indian farmers are set to reduce the area given over to soybeans by up to 10 percent this year in response to falling prices, pushing up likely imports of edible oils such as palm oil and soyoil.</strongSoybean is the main summer-sown oilseed crop for the world's biggest importer of edible oil, but prices have dropped 10 percent in the past two years, while the prices of pulses such as red gram have nearly tripled over the same period.Lower soybean output will force the country to increase imports of edible oils, supporting their prices. It could also limit India's soymeal exports, given prices for its GMO-free produce are already above international prices.The further price rise due to lower supply could even make imports of soymeal viable for local consumers.""In the last two-three years soybeans have given lower returns than competing crops like pulses,"" said K N Rahiman, chief research officer at Ruchi Soya, the country's biggest edible oil refiner.""This year, since pulses prices are ruling near record high levels, farmers will be inclined to shift towards pulses. We could see 5 to 10 percent reduction in soybean area.""Farmers planted 11.63 million hectares with soybean in 2015/16. A 10 percent reduction would cut acreage to around 10.5 million hectares in the 2016/17 marketing year starting July.Most Indian farmers begin cultivating soybean and pulses, which are rain-fed crops, in June after the arrival of the monsoon rains, and they are sown mainly in the states of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Maharashtra in the west, Rajasthan in the north-west, and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the south.Dinesh Garg, a farmer from Morena in Madhya Pradesh, plants soybean during summer, but this year he has decided instead to cultivate red gram, better known locally as tuar.""Soybean is not remunerative due to lower prices. This year I am more interested in growing tuar,"" said Garg, who cultivated soybean on 5 hectares of land last year.Soybean production plunged 20 percent in 2015/16 to its lowest in more than a decade after drought and pests hit output.India exports soymeal mainly to Asian buyers, but the drop in production has forced it to import soymeal and soybean in small quantities for the first time in many years.Since the country imports most of its edible oil, limited soybean supply means imports will go up in 2016/17, said Faiyaz Hudani, associate vice-president, research, at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd.""Even though oilseed production is stagnant, edible oil consumption has been rising steadily due to growth in population and rising prosperity,"" Hudani said.India imports mainly palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, while it brings in soyoil from Argentina and Brazil.",5/24/2016,,

business,Iran Saudi threatens OPEC deal questi,"strong>LONDON/DUBAI: OPEC's thorniest dilemma of the past year - at least from a purely oil standpoint - is about to disappear.</strongLess than six months after the lifting of Western sanctions, Iran is close to regaining normal oil export volumes, adding extra barrels to the market in an unexpectedly smooth way and helped by supply disruptions from Canada to Nigeria.But the development will do little to repair dialogue, let alone help clinch a production deal, when OPEC meets next week amid rising political tensions between arch-rivals Iran and oil superpower Saudi Arabia, OPEC sources and delegates say.Earlier this year, Tehran refused to join an initiative to boost prices by freezing output but signaled it would be part of a future effort once its production had recovered sufficiently. OPEC has no supply limit, having at its last meeting in December scrapped its production target.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) figures, Iran's output has reached levels seen before the imposition of sanctions over its nuclear program. Tehran says it is not yet there.But while Iran may be more willing now to talk, an increase in oil prices has reduced the urgency of propping up the market, OPEC delegates say. Oil has risen toward a more producer-friendly $50 from a 12-year low near $27 in January.""I don't think OPEC will decide anything,"" a delegate from a major Middle East producer said. ""The market is recovering because of supply disruptions and demand recovery.""A senior OPEC delegate, asked whether the group would make any changes to output policy at its June 2 meeting, said: �Nothing. The freeze is finished.�Within OPEC, Iran has long pushed for measures to support oil prices. That position puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia, the driving force behind OPEC's landmark November 2014 refusal to cut supply in order to boost the market.Sources familiar with Iranian oil policy see no sign of any change of approach by Riyadh under new Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih - who is seen as a believer in reform and low oil prices.""It really depends on those countries within OPEC with a high level of production,"" one such source said. ""It does not seem that Saudi Arabia will be ready to cooperate with other members.""HIGHER EXPORTSIran has managed to increase oil exports significantly in 2016 after the lifting of sanctions in January.It notched up output of 3.56 million barrels of oil per day in April, the IEA said, a level last reached in November 2011 before sanctions were tightened.Saudi Arabia produced a near-record-high 10.26 million barrels per day in April and has kept output relatively steady over the past year, its submissions to OPEC show.Iran, according to delegates from other OPEC members, is unlikely to restrain supplies, given that it believes Saudi Arabia should cut back itself to make room for Iranian oil.""Iran won't support any freeze or cut,"" said a non-Iranian OPEC delegate. ""But Iran may put pressure on Saudi Arabia that they hold the responsibility.""Saudi thinking, however, has moved on from the days when Riyadh cut or increased output unilaterally. Talks in Doha on the proposed output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers fell through after Saudi insisted that Iran participate.Indeed, differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which helped found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 56 years ago, over OPEC policy have made cooperation harder - to say nothing of more fundamental disagreements.For more than a decade after oil crashed to $10 in 1997, the two set aside rivalries to manage the market and support prices, although they fell into opposing OPEC camps with Iran wanting high prices and Saudi more moderate.Now, the Sunni-Shia conflicts setting Saudi Arabia and Iran at each other's throats, particularly in Syria and Yemen, make the relationship between the two even more fraught.The two disagree over OPEC's future direction. Earlier in May, OPEC failed to decide on a long-term strategy as Saudi Arabia objected to Iran's proposal that the exporter group aim for ""effective production management"".With that backdrop, ministers may be advised to keep expectations low, an OPEC watcher said.""The only aspiration OPEC should have for its 2 June meeting is simply not to repeat the chaos of the Doha process,"" said Paul Horsnell, analyst at Standard Chartered.""A straightforward meeting with no binding commitments and, most importantly, no overt arguments would be the best outcome for ministers.""",5/25/2016,,

The change in rate hike expectations is still the major theme, but after the end of June the overall sentiment on the rate hike will be pretty much done,"" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.Adding to the woes of the safe-haven bullion, the dollar stood near a two-month peak against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after robust U.S. housing data supported the case for the Fed to raise rates in the near term.A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.The growing confidence towards a pick-up in U.S. economic growth got a boost on Tuesday as official data suggested new U.S. single-family home sales have hit the highest in eight years.The recent negative undertone for gold notwithstanding, some analysts believe a rate increase as early as June seems unlikely and would be discounted by traders, stabilising the yellow metal.""Despite the short term negative pullback, gold is still a strong 2016 performer against a range of alternative assets and these levels are an enticing entry price for long term bulls,"" MKS Group trader James Gardiner said.Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.44 percent to 868.66 tonnes on Tuesday, the first decline in a month.Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.3 percent, to $16.25 an ounce.

Crude buyers also seemed unfazed by a stronger dollar, which typically makes greenback-denominated oil costlier in other currencies.Earlier in the session, oil was supported by the drop in Iraqi oil output to 4.5 million barrels per day from January's record high of 4.78 million bpd.Consultant IHS said just 2.8 billion barrels of oil were discovered outside North America in 2015 following a sharp fall in exploration and appraisal drilling.

business,Mobile phones Step towards a connected futur,"The advent of mobile and smartphone technology has transformed the dynamics of communication in Pakistan. The adoption rates for smartphones are growing rapidly in both urban and rural centers. In 2015, 31% of mobiles purchased in the country were smartphones. Pakistan has approximately 80% mobile user penetration. These mobile phones have become so common that they are not considered a luxury device anymore but rather, an item of necessity. This technology has the potential to solve various day-to-day problems and the ability to lift people out of poverty. In fact, in the life of every individual, a mobile phone plays a critical role.���The reason behind a common man owning a phone can be attributed to price affordability and availability of quality smartphones within the reach of the masses. There are some big names is Pakistan�s smartphone market, but the role which Q Mobile has played for equipping the masses with mobile and smartphones has to be applauded. Q Mobile, which is the largest smartphone brand in Pakistan and enjoys a lion's share in the smartphone market, provides various kinds of phones such as smartphones, feature phones and tablets. It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobile�serves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market. Long distance route truck drivers, who transport goods, can use online maps and GPS to plan their routes. Traders in the rural areas can narrow the gap with their buyers and sellers in urban areas by using mobile broadband. Health related services are also available via smartphones. A recent study by the Santa Fe Institute theorizes that cell phone use could help developing countries plan electrical infrastructure.With so much developments taking place, smartphones clearly represent a growing segment of our economy and are an example of how the availability of technology can propel Pakistan in the global marketplace while improving the lives of a common man at the same time.",5/29/2016,,

Market watchers pin the blame on a campaign against demonstrations of wealth among public officials, as well as a slowdown in economic growth.As things stand, the Chinese buy close to 80 percent of their luxury goods abroad in cities such as Paris, London and Tokyo, Bain Consultancy estimated.""Whether it is Burberry or Richemont recently, many brands in the space have noted that the future of luxury demand will be about the Chinese and incrementally at home,"" said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in Hong Kong, who recommends buying CITS shares.strong>LESS CHOICE</strongIn Hainan, which is closer to Hanoi than Beijing, duty-free shops offering products priced as much as 30 percent less than the mainland have been operating since 2011, under a trial program aimed at developing the island as a tourist destination.Customers could initially only buy up to 8,000 yuan ($1,220) worth of duty-free goods, twice a year. From February 1, they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16,000 yuan. At the same time, stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports.In Hainan's provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island, HNA's duty-free sales have since rocketed.In the island's city of Sanya, state-controlled CITS opened the country's first duty-free shopping centre in 2014. The skylit, flower-shaped edifice is about nine soccer pitches in size and filled with shops stocking over 300 brands including from Burberry Group PLC and Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, as well as goods such as baby formula.""It's definitely much cheaper,"" said 20-something handbag shopper Zhang Pei Pei, ""But the choice of products is less.""CITS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.strong>HOTEL RUSH</strongHainan's balmy climate and over 60 beaches is a draw for developers, with Sanya on the island's southern tip dotted with luxurious resorts completed or under construction. That city - three times the size of Singapore - has over 1,000 hotels with 30 more due to open in its Haitang Bay area in the coming years.One of those is the $1.7 billion Alantis project of Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd and the owner of South Africa's Sun City casino resort, Sol Kerzner.""Fosun is optimistic in the future development of Sanya,"" the company said in an email to Reuters.Near the capital Haikou, property and aviation conglomerate HNA plans to develop a deep-water port, international sports stadium and motor racing circuit, as well as an artificial isle similar to Dubai's Palm Islands.Its aim is to become the country's first duty-free retail brand, HNA said in emailed comments.strong>COSMETIC</strongBut for all the glamour, there are plenty of Chinese ready to spend holiday money on products that are more or less in reach on a daily basis.On one weekday afternoon in CITS' mall, queues snaked out of beauty stores from Chanel SA, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and L'Oreal SA, while the outlets of upmarket watchmakers appeared near-empty.""I just want to buy cosmetics,"" said He, a 30-something from southwestern mainland city of Chongqing, who did not provide her surname.

business,missiles subs Anil Ambani bets big def,"strong>NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Anil Ambani's Reliance Group has never made a military helicopter, missile system or submarine in its history but that isn't stopping the Indian tycoon from seeking to win contracts to manufacture all of that military hardware and more.</strongKnown for taking some ambitious bets over the past decade, some of which have failed to deliver, Ambani's plans to turn Reliance into a major defence company may be one of his boldest yet. It has already bid for 840 billion Indian rupees ($12.5 billion) in government contracts, senior executives said, though it hasn't yet won any of those.The success of the strategy will depend partly on whether he can persuade government officials and international partners that he can build sophisticated equipment and partly on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi can get India's notoriously slow procurement process to work.Modi has made defence a big part of his ""Make in India"" programme. As part of any defence contract, he is demanding foreign companies tie up with a local partner, transfer technology and move some manufacturing to India.At stake is $250 billion in defence contracts the government is expected to award over the next 10 years as it looks to upgrade the military's aging equipment. ""We hope to have a significant share of this pie,"" said R K Dhingra, chief executive of Reliance Defence. He predicted the company will ""emerge as a key player in the defence sector over the next few years.""Reliance's ambition is greeted with scepticism by many in the defence world. An military official involved in defence procurement said Reliance is overreaching in wanting to make everything from ships to planes. Some rivals and potential partners for the contracts said Reliance will struggle to master the manufacture of such a wide range of sophisticated military hardware.""There is no quick money in this branch,"" said Jan Widerstrom, head of Saab India Technologies, a unit of Saab AB. ""It requires a lot of experience, high tech culture, investments and a long-term business plan.""Still, Saab and Reliance are working together in developing the next generation Combat Management System for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard.Recently, Reliance's lack of experience and questions about its ability to handle sensitive technology and intellectual property counted against it in its bid to partner with the Russians to build 200 Kamov helicopters, said a Russian diplomat in New Delhi, who declined to be identified in this story because they weren't speaking in an official capacity.The contract, estimated to be worth a little over $900 million went instead to Indian state-controlled company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Ambani should identify core areas and concentrate on them rather than ""be an inch deep and a mile wide,"" said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defence website Bharat Shakti.strong>RELIANCE GROUP</strongThe Reliance conglomerate split into two in 2005 after a bitter feud between Anil Ambani and his older brother, Mukesh. The latter got the flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining and textiles.Anil got telecoms, power, entertainment and financial services businesses. But some of his businesses struggled, especially an ill-timed foray into infrastructure, and debt piled up.Its Reliance Infrastructure arm, which includes the defence operations, aims to be debt free in the current financial year ending March 2017, according to Lalit Jalan, who is acting CEO of the unit.To get there it plans to sell assets, including road projects and a stake in a power distribution company for about 180 billion rupees, according to another senior Reliance executive. Ambani entered the defence sector last year, when he took a controlling stake in a company that made warships and energy exploration vessels, in Modi's home state of Gujarat, called Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co Ltd, for about 20 billion Indian rupees.That became Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd. Since then, Reliance has bought hundreds of acres of additional land to build an aerospace facility and another shipyard in other parts of the country.It has also signed more than half a dozen joint venture agreements with foreign companies, including one with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems of Israel, to bid for Indian government contracts as they come up.An Israeli defence industry source said for Rafael the idea is that if it wins tenders, Reliance will produce some components for missiles and other systems.strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strongAmbani has said that lack of experience is being held against his company.""Despite a committed reformist mindset at the top, we are still seeing opportunities being denied to new players on grounds of lack of experience,"" Ambani told a 'Make in India' summit on defence in March.Reliance Defence has been building an experienced team. Dhingra earlier headed Lockheed Martin's India operations, and the company has hired a slew of senior army and navy officers who have executed large defence projects from conception to delivery, the Reliance executive said.The group's experience in managing complex projects in India, including building roads and power plants should help it, the executive said. For design, technology and complicated weaponry, Reliance would have a foreign partner, he noted.Reliance expects to spend up to 20 billion rupees over the next three years in upgrading facilities as it gets business, keeping its outlay low as it waits for contracts, the executive said.Thanks to its Pipavav shipyard, Reliance expects the naval part of its business to be the first to take off, he said. It plans to bid for a $7.5 billion submarine contract that the government is expected to give out to replace the navy's ageing and accident-prone fleet and narrow the gap with rival China's rapidly modernizing fleet.Ambani also has plans to bid for contracts in the future to make nuclear-powered submarines.($1 = 67.3 Indian rupees)",5/30/2016,,

business,Saudi Arab reform plan approved top economic counci,"strong>RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's National Transformation Plan, a pivotal element of the ""Vision 2030"" reforms announced in April by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will be put before the cabinet for approval on Monday, a senior Saudi source told Reuters.</strongThe plan is expected to flesh out sector-by-sector details of the implementation of Prince Mohammed's programme, which is intended to restructure the kingdom's entire economy and make it less dependent on oil revenue.""The Council of Economic and Development Affairs has approved the final draft of the National Transformation Plan, which is one of the plans adopted and part of the 2030 vision, which was launched and adopted by the Saudi deputy crown prince, president of CEDA,"" the source said.Prince Mohammed was given a central role in decision making after his father, King Salman, became monarch early last year, taking charge of CEDA, a new supercommittee of top ministers charged with overseeing reforms.Saudi Arabia finances now depend on oil revenue and its economic performance closely tracks government spending. But energy prices have plummeted since mid-2014, causing steep declines in income and putting growth at risk.HIGH PROFILEThe wider reforms are expected to include subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment. Last month the International Monetary Fund said the plans were ""appropriately bold and far reaching"".Details of the plan, a programme of wide-ranging economic reforms, will be disclosed in daily news conferences with government ministers starting Monday evening, the senior source said.Other parts of the Vision 2030, including a partial privatisation of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and transformation of the government's Public Investment Fund into one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, have yet to be approved.The emphasis placed on the plan by Prince Mohammed is evident in the high-profile nature of its launch, with senior ministers expected to deliver rare briefings on how their departments will implement the programme.The timing is also significant because Monday is the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when business and government activity in the conservative Islamic kingdom have historically slowed down. Launching the plan despite the start of the holiday signals a more energetic approach.Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totalled $98 billion in 2015.The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.",6/6/2016,,

All 105 economists polled by Reuters had forecast higher numbers.A Reuters poll of Wall Street's top banks taken after the jobs figures showed that all of them expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged at its June 14-15 policy meeting.""I am still on the side that the U.S. economy is better than these data look, but it is also the case that the Fed has less confidence than I do and the market is unlikely to turn around unless there is a major piece of data that surprises on the upside,"" Steven Englander, managing director and global head of G10 FX strategy at Citigroup in New York, said in a note.Data on the U.S. non-manufacturing sector also disappointed, showing a drop in the May headline index to 52.9 from 55.7 in April.Fed funds futures rates indicated that traders see only a 6 percent chance of a Fed hike this month, down from 21 percent as recently as Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Later in the session on Monday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will address an event in Philadelphia.

An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect,"" he said, referring to a portal supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Modi promised in his 2014 election campaign to recover billions of dollars sent to tax havens abroad to avoid income tax, now about 30 percent in India.Schneider-Ammann said no figure had been put on the amount of ""black money"" to be recovered. Talks would begin later this month, he said.Modi said Switzerland had also agreed to support its bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which it applied to join last month, having won a waiver in 2008 that accorded it the right to trade in commercial nuclear technology.New Delhi's bid for full membership of the 48-nation club, if granted, would tip the balance of power in South Asia against its arch-rival Pakistan, whose own application has been backed by China despite questions over its proliferation record.Modi tacked on Switzerland and Mexico as extra stops on a five-country tour to seek their support on joining the NSG. He left Switzerland for Washington, where U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to offer his backing also.Both Switzerland and Mexico have been viewed as sceptical about India's bid for nuclear legitimacy. They are among countries concerned that India has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a step that would require New Delhi to give up its nuclear arsenal.The nuclear club holds its annual meeting later this month.",6/7/2016,,

business,World Bank slashes global growth forecast to 24 per,"strong>Washington: A worried World Bank slashed its growth forecast for the global economy Tuesday, saying advanced economies are rebounding more slowly than expected and low commodity prices continue to hurt other countries.</strongThe Bank said that the global economy should grow at just 2.4 percent this year, the same lethargic pace of 2015 and much slower than the 2.9 percent it predicted in January.It said that the slow growth in advanced economies is holding back developed countries, with world trade and investment both depressed, and called for Prospects for a pickup ""remain muted,"" the Bank said, in a report especially downbeat for countries dependent on commodity exports like oil.It said risks to growth have risen since the beginning of the year, particularly the high level of borrowing by companies in developing countries, which has left them vulnerable to credit crises as growth stagnates.It also includes the rise in doubts that the aggressive monetary easing in developed countries, with negative interest rates in several, is doing the intended job of firing up economic activity.""Economic growth remains the most important driver of poverty reduction, and that�s why we�re very concerned that growth is slowing sharply in commodity-exporting developing countries due to depressed commodity prices,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.""This sluggish growth underscores why it�s critically important for countries to pursue policies that will boost economic growth and improve the lives of those living in extreme poverty.""The report comes as the main developed country drivers of global growth -- Japan, Europe and the United States -- struggle for traction.A sharp deceleration of the US economy since the beginning of the year is not helping carry the rest of the world, and the World Bank has cut its expectations for the world�s largest economy by 0.8 percentage point to 1.9 percent in 2016.The Euro area will achieve only 1.6 percent growth, and Japan, fighting off deflationary pressures, will manage just 0.5 percent.In all three, the bank said, investment remains soft amid doubts about the efficacy of policies, particularly those of central banks holding interest rates at extraordinarily low levels.China, the other major wheel of growth, will manage to hold onto a 6.7 percent pace, but the Bank sees it slowing further to 6.3 percent by 2018.India too is holding onto a good pace, helped by the cheap prices of key commodities it imports, including oil.But other large emerging economies like Brazil and Russia remain locked in recession, and Nigeria and South Africa are expanding very slowly.""Conditions remain markedly challenging for commodity exporters,"" the Bank said.",6/8/2016,,

A weak dollar can boost demand for crude, which is sold on global markets in the US currency.""A good portion of what we�re seeing during the last couple of days is a reaction to the anticipation the Fed will not change its interest rates and that�s leading to a weaker dollar,"" said James Williams of WTRG Economics.",6/8/2016,,

Traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" Paswan tweeted on Thursday evening.Traders and experts said the new tax could push up global sugar prices, even though India was already expected to become a net importer in the year from Oct. 1 following back-to-back drought years.""Since we are the world's second largest sugar producer there could be a 5 percent impact on global prices but not more,"" said Aurobinda Prasad, vice president research, Kotak Commodities.India exported 2.9 million tonnes of sugar in 2015/16, accounting for 5.3 percent of world exports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures.In a May report, the USDA already forecast sharply reduced exports from India this year of just 1 million tonnes, which would be the lowest since the 2009/10 crop year.""With rising white sugar prices and the weakening rupee, Indian mills could have signed export deals with Sri Lanka. That won't happen now,"" said a Singapore-based trader.Global sugar prices have also been buoyed by cold temperatures in parts of Brazil and growing demand.""Markets were not expecting exports from India but the move to tax sugar exports will definitely have a temporary impact on global prices,"" said a Delhi-based sugar industry expert.He said the plan to tax exports is better than the country's previous moves to ban overseas sales.The move would help rival exporters Thailand and Brazil, said a Mumbai-based trader.""Thailand will benefit more since it has been competing with India in the white sugar market.

business,Islamic trade finance body to expand global reach CEO,"strong>The Jeddah-based International Islamic Trade Finance Corp (ITFC) plans to strengthen its global network of offices in an effort to increase the use of sharia-compliant banking in merchandise trade.</strong""We want to be closer to member countries - to do this we need to decentralise our activities,"" said Hani Salem Sonbol, chief executive of the ITFC, a member of the Islamic Development Bank Group (IDB).The ITFC, which currently has offices in Jakarta, Dakar and Istanbul, will move more staff there and open a branch in Dubai this year to serve as a gateway to Africa, he added. Islamic trade finance, which follows religious principles such as a ban on interest, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars of bank-intermediated trade finance conducted globally every year.But the ITFC, which uses its expertise and funds to facilitate Islamic trade finance, says it is expanding its activities partly through new business with countries outside the traditional core areas of sharia-compliant finance in the Gulf and southeast Asia.Last month, it signed financing agreements with Djibouti, Comoros, Mali and Mauritania, and is exploring transactions in Guyana, the newest member of the IDB Group, Sonbol said. The ITFC approved transactions worth $6.1 billion in the financial year to last October, up from $5.2 billion a year earlier. It more than doubled financing approvals to sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey saw some of the biggest individual increases in approvals.Difficulties in the global economy could dampen further growth but the ITFC aims for around $7 billion of approvals this year, Sonbol said.Traditionally, Islamic banks have not become heavily involved in trade financing as it often requires large balance sheets; they have left such business for Western banks to dominate.To overcome this, the ITFC has developed a network of more than 70 financial institutions which last financial year provided $4.2 billion via 25 syndicated deals, representing 68 percent of the institution�s total trade financing.The rest came from its own resources. Strategic partnerships are growing: Last year, the ITFC closed a $350 million export syndication in favour of Turkey�s export-import bank, and in February it signed a partnership agreement with Morocco�s largest lender by assets, Attijariwafa Bank.The ITFC�s mandate is to promote trade among countries of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Trade within the group accounted for 19.5 percent of OIC countries� total trade in 2015, up from around 12 percent in 2011, and the ITFC aims for 26 percent by 2025, Sonbol said.The IDB is the largest shareholder in the ITFC with 37.6 percent of paid-up capital; Saudi Arabia holds second place with 16.9 percent.<br/> Last year, the ITFC�s general assembly approved an increase of Iran�s subscription by 8,500 shares, which once paid would allow it to take third spot behind Saudi Arabia.",6/12/2016,,

Electricity shortages were among the main election issues in the 2013 poll won by Sharif.ADB is lending Pakistan more than $1 billion over five years as part of efforts to end chronic energy crisis and implement reforms such as privatising parts of the sector and improving transparency.Werner Liepach, ADB's country director for Pakistan, said the bank was ""broadly satisfied about progress being made"" in Pakistan with energy sector reforms.When asked at a news conference if load shedding could be eradicated in two years, Liepach was categorical: ""Yes"". He added it was possible to be done even sooner but it would depend on other factors, such as global oil prices.Sharif's government has made reducing energy shortages a top priority, embarking on construction of new dams, coal-fire power plants and renewable energy projects.Energy Minister Khawaja Asif said the South Asian nation had last week hit record production generation of 17,350 megawatts (MW), though production shortfalls varied between 1,500MW and 4,700MW through the week.",6/20/2016,,

He said pitches often encountered the same problem: Pakistan's image.After a turbulent decade in which Islamist militants staged frequent gun and bomb attacks on cities, some investors still refuse to visit Pakistan and insist on meeting Saigol in Dubai.""Most people have never been to Pakistan. It's a huge problem,"" said Saigol, sipping a cappuccino in an upscale cafe in Islamabad, Pakistan's leafy, affluent capital.""When people visit Pakistan, they see it's actually opposite of what they expect.""Saigol's frustration goes to the heart of Pakistan's struggle to attract foreign investment and boost economic growth from 4.7 percent towards above 6 percent, the minimum level experts say is needed to absorb new entrants into the job market in a nation of 190 million people.Pakistan's $250 billion economy is growing at the fastest pace in eight years but only attracted $1 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the nine months to April. FDI inflows into Indonesia, by comparison, hit $29 billion last year.Many businesses in Pakistan have flourished since 2014, when a military offensive against Islamist groups improved security.Violence is down overall, although deadly attacks are not uncommon. In late March, more than 60 mostly women and children were killed by a suicide bomber in Lahore.In major cities, car sales are rising and shopping malls are sprouting to cater for an expanding middle class.A crime crackdown in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub of 20 million people, has helped spur a real estate boom and new, upmarket seaside restaurants and cafes are overflowing.strong>PERCEPTIONS TAKE TIME TO CHANGE</strongThe progress is in stark contrast to economic instability during the past decade, when the stock market collapsed and Pakistani Taliban militants held territory 100km from Islamabad.The militants have since been contained in small pockets in mountainous areas near the Afghan border and the country's stock market is Asia's best performing index in 2016.""Perceptions change with a lag. Our reality has changed, but it takes a little while for investors to realise that,"" said Miftah Ismail, an adviser to the prime minister tasked with bringing foreign investment into Pakistan.Ismail said he had expected more money to flow from abroad by now, and concedes investors need convincing that Pakistan ""will not revert to type"" by running large deficits and facing foreign exchange crises.Investors will also have to be convinced that political risks are easing in a nuclear-armed nation surrounded by countries with whom it has unstable relations, including arch-foe India.Yet there are tentative signs foreign companies are eyeing Pakistan's fast-growing consumer market.Carmakers Renault-Nissan are considering a plant in Pakistan, and Suzuki, which already has a presence, said it may invest $460 million for a new factory.A Dutch dairy cooperative, FrieslandCampina International Holding, in March announced plans to buy a stake in Pakistani food giant Engro Foods, in a deal estimated at $460 million.strong>INDICATORS ""FLASHING GREEN""</strongOmar Hamid, head of Asia Pacific country risk research for IHS, said interest in Pakistan has soared this year by IHS corporate clients seeking country and political risk analysis.""It's a massive consumer market and the economic indicators are flashing green for many international companies,"" he said.Pakistan's interest rates are at 42-year lows, inflation has been tamed at about 3 percent, the currency is stable and foreign exchange reserves have jumped to all-time highs.The economy is also expected to receive a shot in the arm from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $46 billion roads and energy project.Much of the money is earmarked for power stations to ease chronic electricity shortages which hobble business and investment.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government is so confident about the economy that it plans to end the IMF's $6.7 billion financial assistance programme in September. Analysts say this could prove a risky move if oil prices spike.In Karachi, the business community hopes MSCI's upgrade of Pakistan will herald a return of foreign investors who fled in anger in 2008 when the bourse imposed a floor and trapped them in a collapsing market for three months.""What happen in 2008 could never happen again,"" said Haroon Askari, deputy director of the Pakistan Stock Exchange.Pakistan's main benchmark index has risen more than 500 percent since the start of 2009, but is still considered cheap by some, trading at multiples below other emerging markets due to political and security risks associated with Pakistan.Saigol, founding partner of Baltoro Capital, which manages a new $48.5 million private equity fund, said foreign investors who finally take a serious look at Pakistan are often surprised.""They say they have never seen a country or an economy the size of Pakistan with so little coverage, so under the radar.""",6/20/2016,,

Through these guidelines, the SBP has advised banks/MFBs/DFIS to continuously improve their cyber security controls and procedures so as to anticipate, withstand, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.</strongSBP�s cyber security instructions provide guidelines in the areas of risk ownership and management responsibility; periodic evaluation and monitoring of cyber security controls; regular independent assessment and tests, and industry collaboration and contingency planning.The new instructions require the Board of Directors (BoD) of the institutions to regularly evaluate the adequacy of cyber security systems and action plans with regard to emerging cyber threats.

business,Ireland may assist exporters if Brexit occurs Foreign Minister,"strong>Ireland would have to consider taking steps to assist firms exporting into Britain if its nearest neighbour and largest trade partner votes to leave the European Union, Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told Reuters on Wednesday.</strongIreland's economy is more vulnerable than any other in the EU if Britain opts to leave, and ministers including Flanagan have campaigned in Britain ahead of Thursday's referendum to urge Irish voters living there to vote ""Remain"".Irish exporters would be the first to suffer if Brexit significantly weakened the pound against the euro and Flanagan said concerns had been raised in meetings with trade bodies during the campaign.""It's too early for me to speculate as to the nature of any actions that we may take but we are fully sensitive to the challenge that lies ahead and the need to respond accordingly,"" Flanagan said when asked if there were any policy steps that could aid exporters.strong>DUBLIN: ""In the event of there being a vote to leave, we would be primarily focussed on strategic national Irish interests across a range of issues, primarily economic and trade, so we have prepared a plan across a range of departments.""</strongAround 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion) of goods and services are traded between the United Kingdom and Ireland each week with Irish farmers and food producers, major UK suppliers, particularly vulnerable.Flanagan, serving a second term as foreign minister after his Fine Gael party returned to office last month, also predicted any withdrawal negotiations could take much longer than the two-year period laid down in EU law.Of most concern to Ireland during such a process would be the impact on Northern Ireland, which has the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU.While pro-Brexit campaigners say a vote to leave would not endanger a common travel area that predates both countries' entry into the EU in 1973, Flanagan said he could not see why the reintroduction of a hard border would not be considered.Given the prominence of immigration as a campaign issue, he said, it would seem logical that Britain would be inclined to take some action if it was outside the EU. In that case, Dublin was concerned that the negotiation on a form of border would be done at EU level and therefore not entirely under its control.The fear for many is that any new border restrictions could endanger an 18-year-old peace agreement between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and their Protestant rivals who want to keep Northern Ireland British.""At best, I would point to a period of uncertainty that would affect the great progress that has been made (in Northern Ireland) in recent years,"" Flanagan said in his office in Dublin's government buildings.""And in terms of the peace process, any re-introduction of border controls, either in terms of custom controls for trade or in terms of security, that could well pose us with a difficult challenge.""",6/23/2016,,

business,World stocks tumble as Britain votes for EU exi,"strong>NEW YORK/LONDON: Global capital markets reeled on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, with $2 trillion in value wiped from equity bourses worldwide, while money poured into safe-haven gold and government bonds. Sterling suffered a record plunge.</strongThe blow to investor confidence and the uncertainty the vote has sparked could keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as planned this year, and even spark a new round of emergency policy easing from major central banks.The traditional safe-harbor assets of top-rated government debt, the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose more than 5 percent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to lows last seen in 2012 at 1.5445 percent.Stocks tumbled in Europe. London's FTSE dropped 2.4 percent while Frankfurt and Paris each fell 6 percent to 8 percent. Italian and Spanish markets, and European bank stocks overall, were headed for their sharpest one-day drops ever.Worries that other EU states could hold their own referendums were compounded by the fact that markets had rallied on Thursday, seemingly convinced the UK would vote to stay in.Britain's big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds, Barclays and RBS plunging as much as 30 percent.Stocks on Wall Street opened more than 2 percent lower but cut losses after about an hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 340.24 points, or 1.89 percent, at 17,670.83, the S&amp;P 500 lost 42.11 points, or 1.99 percent, at 2,071.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.74 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,793.31.MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 3.5 percent.Having campaigned to keep the country in the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would step down.Results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.More angst came as Scotland's first minister said the option of another vote for her country to split from the UK - rejected by Scottish voters two years ago - was now firmly on the table.The British pound dived by 18 U.S. cents at one point, easily the biggest fall in living memory, to its lowest since 1985. The euro, in turn, slid 3 percent to $1.1050 as investors feared for its very future.Sterling was last down 7.8 percent at $1.3719, having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.""It's an extraordinary move for financial markets and also for democracy,"" said co-head of portfolio investments of London-based currency specialist Millennium Global Richard Benson.""The market is pricing interest rate cuts from the big central banks and we assume there will be a global liquidity add from them,"" he added.That message was being broadcast loud and clear. The Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability.strong>SHOCKWAVES</strongThe shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions.The safe-haven yen jumped 3.6 percent to 102.29 per dollar, having been as low as 106.81. The dollar's peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.That prompted warnings from Japanese officials that excessive forex moves were undesirable. Traders said they were wary of being caught with exposed positions if the global central banks chose to step in to calm the volatility.Emerging market currencies across Asia and eastern Europe and South Africa's rand all buckled on fears that investors could pull out. Poland saw its zloty slump 4 percent.Europe's natural safety play, the 10-year German government bond, surged to send its yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid almost 5 percent, Tokyo's Nikkei saw its worst fall since 2011, down 7.9 percent.Financial markets have been gripped for months by worries about what a British exit from the EU would mean for Europe's stability.""Obviously, there will be a large spill-over effects across all global economies ... Not only will the UK go into recession, Europe will follow suit,"" predicted Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney.strong>BOND RALLY</strongInvestors stampeded into low-risk sovereign bonds, with U.S. 10-year notes gained two full points in price to yield 1.521 percent. Earlier, the yield dipped to 1.406 percent, only slightly higher than a record low 1.38 percent reached in July 2012.�Right now it�s 'every man for himself' safety buying,"" said Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York.The rally even extended to UK bonds, despite a warning from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's that it was likely to downgrade Britain's triple-A credit rating if it left the EU. Yields on benchmark 10-year gilts fell 27 basis points to 1.0092 pct.Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.""A July (hike) is definitely off the table,"" said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon.Fed funds futures were even toying with the chance that the next move could be a cut in U.S. rates.Oil prices slumped by more than 4 percent amid fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand. U.S. crude shed $2.12 to $47.99 a barrel while Brent fell as much as 6 percent to $47.83 before clawing back to $48.60.Industrial metal copper sank 3 percent but gold galloped more than 6 percent higher thanks to its perceived safe haven status.",6/24/2016,,

In Asian afternoon trade it was at $1.3387.""Leave�s victory has delivered one of the biggest market shocks of all time,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The reverberations of the vote will be felt around the world.""The extent of the damage on asset prices is hard to gauge but it�s likely to be bigger than anything since Lehmans at the very least,"" he added, referring to the Wall Street bank whose collapsed precipitated the global financial crisis.The dollar slumped briefly to 99.02 yen, the first time it has gone below 100 yen since November 2013, before edging back up above 101 yen. The Japanese unit is considered a safe bet in times of uncertainty and turmoil.The Bank of Japan said Friday it was ready to work with other central banks to pump cash into financial markets to combat wild swings, while the Bank of England said it would take ""all necessary steps"" to avert a full-blown crisis.Earlier Japan�s Finance Minister Taro Aso vowed a ""firm response"" to volatility if necessary.

Foreign dignitaries, including the presidents of Taiwan, Chile, and other Central American nations, will be present at the ceremony.A Chinese-owned Neopanamax-class cargo ship will be the first vessel to officially test the new infrastructure, entering from the Atlantic and exiting into the Pacific a few hours later.The Neopanamax vessels are much bigger than the Panamax-class ships that previously were the largest able to pass through the 80-kilometer (50-mile) long canal. Each is able to haul three times as much cargo as the smaller predecessors.The expansion work began in 2007 and was meant to have been completed in 2014, but it ran well past deadline, and over budget.The expansion is estimated to have cost $5.5 billion. But there are outstanding disputes between the Spanish- and Italian-led consortium that carried out the work and the Panamanian government that could hike that figure by hundreds of millions more.<br/> <br/> For Panama, the unveiling of the broader canal is a moment of pride and of opportunity.Now, ships as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall, and as broad as Olympic-sized swimming pools, will be able to use the canal.Annual cargo volumes should double over the next decade, leading Panama to hope to triple the $1 billion in shipping fees it receives each year.Also, with the country these days linked to the ""Panama Papers"" scandal of offshore businesses owned by the world�s wealthy and influential, the expanded canal is seen as a chance to burnish the country�s tarnished image.This will show the ""real face of Panama,"" the head of the Panama Canal Authority, Jorge Quijano told AFP in an interview this week.World trade should also benefit from what will essentially be an inter-oceanic highway for goods between the United States and Asia. More cargo on bigger ships should mean lower transport costs.Panama is also avidly eying the lucrative market of transporting liquefied natural gas between the United States and Asia, principally to Japan.The ships carrying the gas were too big to use the old canal. With the expansion, they now can.""The inauguration of the expanded Panama Canal means new opportunities for international trade,"" Panama�s president said.Currently some five percent of global maritime commercial traffic uses the canal, which provides a valuable shortcut between North America and Asia.",6/25/2016,,

It has the tools to ensure financial solvency, but not economic activity,"" they said.Finance minister George Osborne said on Monday the economy would have to face up to ""an adjustment"" as it dealt with the fallout of 'Brexit'. But investors again shunned the pound and sought the safety of government bonds.UK money and bond markets moved to price in lower interest rates, with swaps rates now almost fully implying a 0.25 percentage-point cut from the BoE by the end of the year.The yield on 10-year UK government bonds tumbled as much as 15 basis points to a new low of 0.933 percent, and two-year yields fell more than 10 basis points to a four-year low of 0.129 percent.The 10-year yield has fallen 44 basis points since Thursday, its biggest two-day fall since March 2009.""You'd have expected there to be some psychological barrier to gilts breaking through 1 percent, but not today,"" said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.""Gilt yields just kept dropping.

Several banks, including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, cut their sterling forecasts too.""With the Leave vote creating greater uncertainty over the outlook for the economy and BoE policies biased towards further easing/renewed QE, sterling is vulnerable to further near-term selling pressure,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, FX strategist at BAML.""A push below $1.30 cannot be ruled out,"" he added.Others, like Unicredit, reckon the pound will fall even further, perhaps to $1.20 or even lower.",6/27/2016,,

business,ADB approves 600m loan for Pakistan structural refor,"MANILA, Philippines: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $600 million loan program, with a first subprogram of $300 million, to help Pakistan roll out major structural reforms to improve the performance and financial sustainability of its public sector enterprises.�Many large public sector enterprises rely on fiscal transfers from the federal government just to run their day-to-day operations, and there is no available funding for longer term capital spending and development,� said Werner Liepach, Country Director for ADB�s Pakistan Resident Mission.��This assistance will give the government the �fiscal breathing space� it needs to proceed with measures to create more sustainable businesses, delivering more efficient and cost-effective services to the Pakistani public, and will eventually free up public funds for vital social sector spending.�The federal government owns 191 public sector enterprises employing around 420,000 workers. A fiscal consolidation drive to improve federal finances has constrained the federal government from carrying out important reforms related to the public sector enterprises, including a reduction in contingent liabilities from pensions and other related costs. Among enterprises that need immediate financial support for initiating important reforms are power distribution companies and Pakistan Railways.The full program will help the government draw up and roll out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the financial transparency of public sector enterprises and to strengthen their corporate governance. It will include support to establish a retirement cost fund to manage huge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers. Unfunded pension risk presents a serious threat to the financial health of the enterprises.Measures to strengthen auditing, accounting and other elements of operations at Pakistan Railways will also be supported by the program, along with actions to improve the performance of federal financial sector entities to boost financial inclusion in the country.The program is part of a broader, coordinated donors package for public sector enterprise reforms, with other assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The program loans will be extended in two equal subprograms of $300 million each, with the first subprogram running for a year to June 2017 and the full program finishing in June 2018.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB in December 2016 will mark 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members-48 from the region.

Despite the government and industry�s efforts, farmers in top-producing Punjab have reduced area,"" said Saleem Saleh, acting secretary general of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA).Unpredictable weather, such as floods late last year as well as poor rainfall in recent months, and the resultant uncertainty about yields is putting many farmers off cotton, stymieing Pakistan�s efforts to boost local output.""Farmers are finding other crops profitable,"" said Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginner�s Association.The country�s cotton output fell by a third to 9.7 million bales in 2015/16, forcing it to import a record 4 million bales in the year, up from 1.2 million a year ago, according to APTMA.Pakistan annually consumes around 15 million.Even for the season starting Aug. 1, weather has not been supportive and the crop in Punjab has already been hurt by poor rains in May and June, said Khan.Cotton sowing in Pakistan starts from April and harvesting begins in July.While the country has set a production target of 14.1 million bales for the new season, industry officials say output will fall short and that rainfall over the next few weeks will be crucial in determining yields.""Import requirement is rising as local consumption is rising, but production is stagnant.This year imports jumped due to crop failure. Next year also imports would remain around this year�s level. Actual number depends on production,"" Saleh said.Typically lower output in Pakistan implies an exporting opportunity for neighbouring India.In fact, the latter shipped out about 6.5 million bales this season, with Pakistan taking nearly 2 million.""India has freight advantage over other suppliers. Naturally India will be the preferred choice for buyers in Pakistan whenever they start imports,"" Cotton Association of India President Dhiren Sheth said.However, India�s move to contract 20,000 bales from Pakistan for import this month indicates supply at the top producer is also running thin.",6/29/2016,,

business,US economy looks strong with 287000 jobs added in Ju,"WASHINGTON: US employers added new workers at a surprisingly strong rate in June after an unnerving stall in May, in a clear demonstration of economic resilience, the Labor Department reported Friday.The much better-than-expected numbers gave a boost to markets in the US and Europe, which have been battered down by worries that Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union will drag down economic growth.Private businesses and government authorities across the United States generated 287,000 new positions last month, 112,000 more than analysts had expected.The strongest hiring was in the health care, hospitality, information and retail sales sectors, while government hiring also picked up.That largely compensated for the poor numbers from May that had shocked policymakers and markets, sending the dollar lower and contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to put off an interest rate hike.The May job creation numbers in fact were revised downward in Friday's data from the original 38,000 reported to just 11,000.June's hiring levels boosted the monthly average of the last three months to a solid 147,000, which economists say is adequate to keep bringing down unemployment overall.""This is a good trend but nothing spectacular. It suggests that hiring has taken a step down since late last year but that job growth is still strong enough to absorb slack in the labor market,"" said analysts at Nomura Global Economics in a client note.""Most important, today's report quells any concerns of a broader economic slowdown in the US.""Markets reacted positively, with the S&amp;P 500 surging 1.5 percent to a fraction shy of an all-time record.In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index gained 2.2 percent Paris's CAC 40 added 1.8 percent, while in London the FTSE 100 barometer rose 0.9 percent.As analysts said the data increases the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least once before the end of the year, early in the session the dollar jumped and US bond yields, which had plunged in recent weeks, spiked higher.The jobs numbers were not unequivocally good. Wage growth, another indicator of economic strength, slowed slightly, bringing the annual pace for the last three months to 2.5 percent, compared with the 12-month rate of 2.6 percent.And the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate database from the job creation numbers, rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 percent, though still near the lowest level in more than eight years.That rise was mainly due to a large jump in the number of people reported rejoining the workforce, diluting the impact of the hiring surge on the jobless rate.In May the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.0 percent to 4.7 percent after the volatile data showed a huge number of people had dropped out of the labor force.�",7/9/2016,,

business,EU takes China to WTO over export curb,"BRUSSELS: The European Union on Tuesday followed the United States to launch a new legal challenge at the World Trade Organization over duties and quotas China imposes on its raw materials exports.The EU said China is violating WTO rules with restrictions on exports of key materials such as graphite, cobalt, chromium and magnesia which help Chinese industry at the expense of European companies and consumers.""We cannot sit on our hands seeing our producers and consumers being hit by unfair trading practices,"" the EU�s top trade official Cecilia Malmstroem said in a statement.The EU launched similar successful actions against China in 2012 and 2014 over rare earths and raw materials like bauxite, zinc and coke.The new challenge targets export restrictions on graphite, cobalt, copper, lead, chromium, magnesia, talcum, tantalum, tin, antimony and indium.""The past two WTO rulings on Chinese export restrictions have been crystal clear -- these measures are against international trade rules,"" Malmstroem said.""As we do not see China advancing to remove them all, we must take legal action,"" she added.In filing a similar action last week before the WTO, the US government said that when China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to eliminate such export duties but had failed to follow through on the commitment.The US action covered nine of the 11 materials mentioned in the EU action, excluding chromium and indium.These raw materials are essential for a broad range of industry, from aerospace and car manufacturing to electronics and chemicals.In Washington, the US trade representative�s office said China�s export duties ranged from five to 20 percent, raising prices for overseas buyers while Chinese companies paid much less and had more secure supplies.In addition, the export duties put pressure on non-Chinese manufacturers to shift production, technologies and jobs to China, it said.As with the US challenge, the EU action launches formal consultations with China as a first step to settle the dispute.If the two sides fail to reach a settlement in 60 days, the EU may decide to ask the WTO to establish a panel to determine whether China�s measures are compatible with the Geneva-based body�s rules.The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, is due Wednesday to review trade links with China ahead of a December deadline whereby, under the terms of its WTO accession, the country should be regarded as a normal market economy, not one where the state plays a central role.",7/19/2016,,

business,Gold glisters diamonds hedge the ri,"strong>GENEVA/LONDON: In a packed Christie's auction room in Geneva, one could hear a pin drop as two anonymous bidders slugged it out in their quest to own the world's most exquisite blue diamond.</strongThe room in the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues was filled with multi-millionaire collectors and diamond dealers, listening intently as the bidders, each speaking by phone to a Christie's representative, took turns adding a few hundred thousand dollars in a tense struggle dragging on for more than half an hour.When the auctioneer's hammer came down, spontaneous applause broke out as the winner, who retained anonymity, bought the 14.62-carat Oppenheimer Blue for a world record $57.5 million for any jewel sold at auction. The sale some weeks ago was the latest in a series of world record prices per carat paid at auction for extraordinarily magnificent and rare diamonds.With new fortunes being created around the world faster than at any time in history, more of this expanding elite of wealthy investors are looking at different ways of protecting cash that now earns close to zero percent interest in bank accounts, while asset market turbulence can wipe out millions in hours.Some are eyeing rare diamonds as a best friend, or long-term haven at least. And it's no longer just a top table of ""super rich"" billionaires who are gravitating to this arcane world.A second division of wealthy is emerging. They can't afford the Oppenheimer Blue, perhaps, but they can take a stake in rare diamonds via specialist investment funds.strong>PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS' CLUB ONLY</strongThese gem specialists are keen to play up rare diamonds as ""safety"" investments, or at least a way to hedge against currency, stock and bond market volatility at a time of political and economic uncertainty. Britain's shock vote last month to leave the European Union underlines their point.""The big players are looking at diamonds in a different way,"" said Ehud Laniado, chief executive of Cora International, which sold the 12.03-carat Blue Moon diamond for $48.4 million at a Sotheby's Geneva sale in November, a world record for any jewel sold at auction at the time.""They are not looking at them just as a jewel, but as an asset that has a resale value.""Citigroup said the outlook for gold remained uncertain partly due to concerns about a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. In such a scenario, investors may look at a next-best alternative such as diamonds.However, the diamond investors' club is shut to most ordinary savers due to its complicated, insider nature - characterised by poor liquidity, a lack of price transparency and high fees. While some are making efforts to create a liquid market, the process has been slow.Entry level for Sciens Coloured Diamond Fund II, one of the more established closed-end funds now shut to new investors, is $1 million. It invests in diamonds in rare colours such as red.The fund, which manages around $50 million, uses trading and buy-and-hold strategies for long-term appreciation. One of its strategies is to improve the value of stones by finding a rare matching pair in the same colour, size and shape. They are eventually sold to buyers such as jewellers and collectors.Some funds also loan diamonds to jewellers who wish not to maintain a large inventory. If the jeweller decides to make a unique ring for a client, he can buy a diamond from the fund.The Sciens fund, launched in 2014, rose in value by about 5 percent in the second quarter of 2016, said Philip Baldwin, managing director of Sciens Diamond Management BV. He and Mahyar Makhzani run the fund, based on the Caribbean island of Curacao.""Colour diamonds are considered a safe haven,"" he said. ""Colour diamonds are a hedge against inflation, currency risk, market fluctuations and political uncertainty.""Solitaire Diamond Co, another diamond-backed fund now closed to new investors, is backed by an assortment of white diamonds of high-grade clarity and cut weighing under 5 carats, which are certified by international laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America.Fred Sinclair-Brown, Solitaire fund manager, said it made a gross margin of 20 percent over the past 12 months, above expectations of 14 to 16 percent. He said he was planning another diamond fund for professional investors, this time possibly backed by coloured gems.strong>INVESTORS SEE SPARKLE IN COLOUR GEMS</strongPrices of vivid and intense colour diamonds have risen 10 to 12 percent a year on average since 1959, according to Baldwin. However, dealers said white diamond prices had not gained as quickly in recent years and were largely flat in 2016.The most prominent white diamond to come to auction recently, the 1,109-carat Lesedi la Rona, failed to sell at Sotheby's in London last month, highlighting that diamond markets are not bulletproof.Diamond markets slowed in the second quarter as selective buyers pushed for deeper discounts. Polished inventory continued to rise and prices came under pressure, while rough trading remained resilient.Despite a handful of diamond-backed initiatives, fund managers have struggled over the years to find the right investment vehicles for diamonds due to illiquidity, a lack of price transparency and high transaction fees.""I am very dubious about diamond-backed investment because the price of diamonds is not listed anywhere and the market is too illiquid,"" said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas and former global equity fund manager of BCS Asset Management.Fund managers pointed to very separate markets for white diamonds. While white diamonds can be correlated to the commercial market for bridal jewellery, colour gems are in a unique investment category. Part of the problem with diamond investing is that different categories make it difficult to compile generic prices.A recent Citigroup poll found that about one-third of the respondents were willing to invest in a diamond product having homogeneity and liquidity.Martin Rapaport, head of the Rapaport Group, which has its own polished diamond price list widely used by the trade, is trying to create a more liquid market for investment-grade diamonds by developing a transparent price structure. He hopes to launch a fund backed by diamonds within a couple of years.""Diamonds can be a good investment, but you have to be careful,"" he told Reuters. ""You need to know the bid/ask spread, the price you can sell diamonds back on the same day.""",7/20/2016,,

Forecasts had called for a much more modest increase of 185,000 jobs.Private businesses and government employers added 292,000 jobs in June, not the 287,000 first reported, and 24,000 jobs in May, not the very low, downward-revised figure of 11,000.""This month�s report confirms that the Great Recession is indeed in the nation�s rearview mirror -- the economy has added jobs for 70 consecutive months, the longest streak on record,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said.On the White House campaign trail, Clinton has painted a picture of optimism and jobs growth, while Trump has cast America as an economy in decline -- Friday�s numbers can only help Clinton.The Trump campaign sought to downplay the news, with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller saying the recovery was the weakest since the Great Depression, with conditions largely disfavoring working people.""Entire communities have been wiped out by off-shoring,"" said Miller.<br/>""Many workers today are earning less than they did in 1970, and household incomes are down nearly $2,000 under the Obama administration.""/><strong>�Fed rate hike?</strongThe closely watched jobs figures help fill out a complex economic picture for market observers eager for signs of whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year.Monetary policy makers earlier this year veered off a course of planned, successive rate hikes as some signs emerged that the American economy might not be on sure footing.The Commerce Department said last month that economic activity had grown by a paltry 1.2 percent in the second quarter.But that data was at odds with Friday�s rosier jobs report.

Together, both sectors have added nearly a million jobs in the last 12 months, according to the Labor Department.Employment in mining continued to fall, losing 6,000 positions from the prior month and putting the industry down 220,000 jobs since a peak hit in September 2014.The average workweek rose 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours while average hourly earnings inched upwards by 8 cents to $25.69, up 2.6 percent since the start of the year./><strong>Stocks up</strongEquities markets reacted favorably to the news, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at 2,182.87, about four points above the all-time record set last month.The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also set a record, closing up 1.1 percent at 5,221.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 1.0 percent at 18,543.53, only 12 points from its record.""We believe the trend remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining over time,"" said Jim O�Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.""Today�s report helps the case for more Fed tightening before too long -- if strength is sustained -- although officials are being ultra cautious/dovish as they worry about downside risks,"" he added.",8/6/2016,,

business,Swiss court backs Iran decades old oil row Isr,"strong>ZURICH: Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.</strongThe Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,,

Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.�We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages,� he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",8/12/2016,,

Aw said.At around 0700 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September was down 36 cents, or 0.79 percent, to $45.38 and Brent crude for October dropped 41 cents, or 0.85 percent, to $47.94.Nigerian Petroleum Minister of State Emmanuel Kachikwu in a Twitter post Monday also voiced doubts about output cuts by OPEC.""On oil production cuts by OPEC, optimism on my part is quite sparse,"" he said. OPEC member Nigeria is Africa�s biggest oil exporter.Oil prices had entered a ""bear"" market at the start of the month on oversupply concerns, falling more than 20 percent and closing below $40 a barrel for the first time since April.Any agreement to curb production would help rebalance the crude oil market, where output has been running ahead of demand.""The chances of a deal actually occurring at next month�s OPEC meeting are minimal,"" Angus Nicholson, a strategist at IG Markets, said in an email commentary.""The Saudis are happy to commit to some sort of OPEC-wide supply freeze deal so long as Iran is party to it. And Iran refuses to agree to any deal that will inhibit them from lifting their oil output to pre-sanctions levels.""",8/16/2016,,
business,British shoppers begin feel post Brexit pi,"strong>LONDON: From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britain�s decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.</strongThe consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the country�s tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pound�s plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar group�s London office.""We wouldn�t expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices,"" he told AFP.""Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.""strong>- Diluted purchasing power -</strongPrice comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming ""fears of Brexit"" for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexit�s tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.""It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited,"" warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.""Companies may well look to clamp down on workers� pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.""Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",8/17/2016,,

This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.""If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally,"" he said.""We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.""An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",8/18/2016,,

Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.strong>WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

Forecasts had called for a much more modest increase of 185,000 jobs.Private businesses and government employers added 292,000 jobs in June, not the 287,000 first reported, and 24,000 jobs in May, not the very low, downward-revised figure of 11,000.""This month�s report confirms that the Great Recession is indeed in the nation�s rearview mirror -- the economy has added jobs for 70 consecutive months, the longest streak on record,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said.On the White House campaign trail, Clinton has painted a picture of optimism and jobs growth, while Trump has cast America as an economy in decline -- Friday�s numbers can only help Clinton.The Trump campaign sought to downplay the news, with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller saying the recovery was the weakest since the Great Depression, with conditions largely disfavoring working people.""Entire communities have been wiped out by off-shoring,"" said Miller.<br/>""Many workers today are earning less than they did in 1970, and household incomes are down nearly $2,000 under the Obama administration.""/><strong>�Fed rate hike?</strongThe closely watched jobs figures help fill out a complex economic picture for market observers eager for signs of whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year.Monetary policy makers earlier this year veered off a course of planned, successive rate hikes as some signs emerged that the American economy might not be on sure footing.The Commerce Department said last month that economic activity had grown by a paltry 1.2 percent in the second quarter.But that data was at odds with Friday�s rosier jobs report.

The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,,

Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.strong>WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated. Their interest in beauty and expectations of cosmetics are high and they are willing to try new concepts,"" L'Oreal Korea said in emailed comments to Reuters.

business,Swiss court backs Iran decades old oil row Isr,"strong>ZURICH: Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.</strongThe Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,,

All the passengers and crew escaped unharmed, but a firefighter died tackling the blaze.Just six days later, Khadar discovered that the lottery ticket he�d bought on the way to India was now worth $1 million.A fleet administrator with a Dubai car dealership, Khadar told Gulf News he habitually bought a lottery ticket on his way to visit family in the southern Indian state of Kerala.Ticket number 845 in the ""Millenium Millionaire"" draw at the airport�s Dubai Duty Free proved to be his winning shot.""I live a simple life, and now that it�s my time to retire, I feel like God gave me a second life when I survived the plane crash, and blessed me with this money to follow all this up by doing good things,"" he told Gulf News.Khadar has lived in Dubai for 37 years and is married with two children, one of whom is paralysed after a fall early on in his childhood, reported Gulf News.Khadar told Gulf News he was planning to return to Kerala to retire and would use the money to help children in Kerala who need financial support.He said he earns around $2,200 (2,000 euros) a month, and would continue to work as long as he could.""Nothing else can give you the satisfaction of your hard-earned money,"" he said.",8/11/2016,,
business,Sales Tax initiatives check huge tax evasi,"strong>ISLAMABAD: The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.</strongThe Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.�We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages,� he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",8/12/2016,,

This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.""If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally,"" he said.""We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.""An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",8/18/2016,,

""The big fear is that London will lose a lot of the financial service jobs that has made it such a global financial center.""New York gained $10.3 billion in cross-border investments in the first six months of the year compared with the $6.9 billion that London took in, data from JLL show. In the same year-ago period, London garnered $12.4 billion while $11.3 billion flowed to New York, according to JLL.The 8.9 percent decline in cross-border investment New York experienced is in-line with the roughly 10 percent decline major cities experienced this year when compared to 2015, a stellar year in property investment around the world.Concerns the UK market was coming toward the end of the cycle amid signs pricing was reaching unsustainable levels only partially explains the drop-off in investment flows to Britain, the largest decline since the financial crisis.It is now obvious that people were becoming increasingly nervous about the Brexit vote, Green-Morgan said.Britain is viewed as more investor friendly than the United States because of beneficial tax arrangements. However, underlying property fundamentals - strong demand and not too much supply - must be in place to attract capital, as now is the case for the U.S. office and multifamily real estate sectors.The uncertainties created by Brexit has made investors more cautious about Britain and to a lesser extent about Europe, said Ken McCarthy, senior managing director, regional research director for Tri-State New York at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

business,Illicit gold Indias smugglers shut out refiners b,"strong>MUMBAI: Indian gold refiners just months ago were ramping up capacity and struggling to secure enough ore from miners. Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.</strongGold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called ""grey market"" where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.""Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations,"" James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.""Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold. With local scrap supplies we can produce 20 tonnes of refined gold in the current year,"" said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.strong>SMUGGLING GROWS</strongIndia raised the duty on gold imports to 10 percent three years ago, aiming to dampen buying and narrow the current account deficit in a country where gold is seen as a store of wealth for rich and poor alike.Smugglers evade the duty and offer cheap gold to buyers such as bullion dealers and small jewelers, who can pay up to $100 an ounce below official domestic prices, currently around $1,340 an ounce.Falling gold prices deterred the illicit trade last year but smuggling has surged in recent months amid rising prices and the reintroduction in March of a 1 percent local sales tax on gold jewelry.Smuggled gold into India could double to as much as 300 tonnes in 2016, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, although the World Gold Council (WGC) has put the figure at 160 tonnes. At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.strong>BANKS HIT</strongThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.""Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets,"" Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.""So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent,"" he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.""Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount,"" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.""The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.""I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.""In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

It was dealt further blows in July when a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice. Two weeks later, two men killed a priest in a small town in Normandy. Strikes against a controversial labour reform and floods in June also deterred tourists.Nightly hotel stays were down 8.5 percent in the Paris-Ile de-France region in the first half, with an 11.5 percent decline for foreign tourists and a 4.8 percent drop for French tourists.Japanese visitors were down 46.2 percent in the first half compared with the same period in 2015, while Russians were down 35 percent, Chinese down 19.6 percent, and Americans down 5.7 percent, the Paris region tourist board statement said.France is the most-visited country in the world, with almost 85 million foreigners last year, including 16 million in Paris.Weak activity in France contributed to a fall in first-half operating profit for French group AccorHotels.

business,Welspun scandal plummeting Egyptian cotton outpu,"strong>NEW YORK: A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U.S. big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high-end fiber market: there isn't much Egyptian cotton any more.</strongThe shortage of cotton from Egypt, which commands a premium due to its superior quality, creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether, cotton traders said, exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years.Welspun India has lost 42 percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer, one of the world's largest, accusing it of substituting cheaper, non-Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases.Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is ""long staple"" or ""extra long staple,"" meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high-end cotton than Egypt, cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop.But Egypt's cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass-produced items made from short- or medium-staple fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The decline has become a full-fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies, and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice, the USDA said.Egypt will produce just 160,000 480-lb bales of cotton in 2016/17, down from 1.4 million bales as recently as 2004/05, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of expected global output.This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not, or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure, said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville, South Carolina.""If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale, and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that's produced, it would lead one to scratch one's head,"" Lea said.strong>A GOLD SEAL?</strongLong and extra long staple cotton is rare - it makes up just 2.5 percent of annual world cotton production of more than 100 million bales, according to the USDA - and trades at a substantial premium.U.S. extra long staple cotton, or ""pima,"" trades for 152.25 cents per lb, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, a 125 percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U.S., a contract that accepts cotton of a ""strict low middling staple length"".Ron Lawson, a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma, California, said he had ""no idea"" what Egyptian cotton prices were, which he said showed how much of a ""novelty"" item the fiber was.Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U.S. Textile Act and Rules, which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target's allegations or had started an investigation.Egypt's cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting. In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's ""Gold Seal,"" which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was ""an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.""The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.""The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now,"" Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.",8/25/2016,,

business,Australia warns shipbuilder DCNS security ,"strong>SYDNEY: Australian defence officials warned French naval contractor DCNS to beef up security in Australia, where it is preparing to build a A$50 billion ($38.13 billion) fleet of submarines, in the wake of a massive data leak, a government spokesman said on Friday.</strongDCNS was left reeling after more than 22,000 pages outlining details relating to submarines it is building for India were published in The Australian newspaper earlier this week, sparking concerns about its ability to protect sensitive data.A senior Australian defence official, acting on orders from Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne, warned DCNS that the government was deeply concerned by the implications of the leak, a spokesman for the minister told Reuters.DCNS is locked in exclusive negotiations with Australia to build a fleet of 12 next-generation submarines after seeing off its rivals, Germany's Thyssenkrup AG and a Japanese government-backed consortium of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.DCNS said earlier this week that the leak, which covered details of the Scorpene-class model and not the vessel currently being designed for the Australian fleet, bore the hallmarks of ""economic warfare"" carried out by frustrated competitors.TKMS Australia, the German shipbuilder's local subsidiary, declined to respond to the accusation. Mitsubishi Heavy Industry also said that it had no comment.A senior industry source who was involved in the Australian submarine bidding called the allegation an ""extraordinary"" attempt to deflect attention from DCNS' security shortcomings.""Clearly there's been a massive leak. And for the French to seek to blame either the Japanese or the Germans under some banner of 'economic warfare' is hysterical,"" he told Reuters.The French victory in one of the world's most valuable defence contracts was a major blow to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to develop defence export capabilities as part of a more muscular security agenda.Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne visited Tokyo this week to meet with her Japanese counterpart, Tomomi Inada, in the first such visit since the contract was awarded.DCNS and TKMS are currently locked in another competition for a lucrative contract to replace Norway's fleet of aging Ula-class submarines. The European shipbuilders, the world's biggest suppliers of conventional submarines, regularly lock horns.($1 = 1.3115 Australian dollars)",8/26/2016,,

U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $2.80 an ounce at $1,323.10.Gold whipsawed on Friday, rising as much as 1.5 percent in the immediate wake of Yellen's comments, before slipping back to end the day marginally lower.""The market was surprised (by Yellen) -- that is why it went all the way up first, before losing it all,"" Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland, said.

business,China G20 West derail agend,"strong>BEIJING: China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage.</strongEnsuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be.Beijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said.""From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them,"" said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea.In recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington.While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media.China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders.State media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers.""Let's make cooperation ever higher,"" it wrote in a commentary last week.But the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.""Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules,"" the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary.""These new rules will exclude China.""strong>ANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA</strongOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia.Australia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project.But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it.Joerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. ""It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies,"" Wuttke told Reuters.A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism.""The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence,"" the official added.None of this will make for plain sailing at G20.""China is angry with almost everyone at the moment,"" said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit.To be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat.""It's very important from the stance of national pride,"" said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics.""It's a minefield for China.""strong>JAPAN WORRIES</strongThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Last week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be ""constructive"" at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States.Wang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble.""Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case,"" Wang wrote.""Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.""",8/29/2016,,

The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday.

That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again"", Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.""The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal.

business,Consumer giants Muslims halal face creams ,"strong>LONDON/JAKARTA: Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow.</strongUnilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019.The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.""It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,"" said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.""There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.""More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.strong>NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA</strongFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year.

But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.""Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,"" he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.""But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.""He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.""We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,"" he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)",9/2/2016,,
business,India Ambani telecoms venture free calls cut price d,"strong>MUMBAI: Reliance Industries unveiled its Jio telecom network on Thursday, touting free calls and rock-bottom data prices that sent shares of established telecom players into a nosedive on fears of an all-out price war.</strongReliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, told the energy group's annual shareholders' meeting that services on the Jio network would be available for free until Dec. 31 in a ""welcome offer"".Reliance, which has been giving freebies for the past few months as part of network testing, did not say when it would start billing customers.Reliance, one of India's biggest conglomerates which gets most of its revenue from its sprawling oil and gas business, has in recent years expanded into more consumer-facing markets such as retail and telecoms as growth slows in its core business.The company, which secured telecom airwaves in 2010, has so far invested more than $20 billion on building a nationwide network and has pledged to offer affordable services to price-conscious Indian customers.Ambani, who was interrupted by repeated rounds of applause as he took shareholders in a packed auditorium through Jio's ambitious rollout plans, free countrywide roaming offering and more, vowed to ""transform India from a high-priced data market to one with the lowest data rates anywhere in the world.""Jio could make Reliance a big provider of telecoms and internet services across India - a nation of 1 billion mobile phone subscribers - and is a key plank of Ambani's strategy, even though the business is unlikely to add significantly to group profits any time soon.Jio will effectively price 1 gigabyte of data at about 50 rupees on average, about one-fifth of what rivals charge, Reliance said in a statement.Ambani set a target of 100 million customers for Reliance Jio ""in the shortest possible time"", without specifying.strong>PRICE WAR</strongShares in India's No. 1 wireless carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd dropped 6.3 percent while smaller rival Idea Cellular fell 10.5 percent, on fears that Jio's aggressive rates will trigger a price war. Incumbents have already started lowering data prices ahead of Jio's entry.Bharti Airtel said: ""We welcome Reliance Jio�s entry to the digital world and wish them the very best,"" but made no comment on the new entrant's price plans. Idea did not comment.Still, one telecom analyst with a foreign brokerage said Jio would face challenges in luring low-spending phone users to its network.Jio's cheapest of 10 plans starts at 149 rupees ($2.22) a month and offers just 0.3 gigabytes of data, while the next monthly plan costs 499 rupees for 4 GB of data. It will also offer a 299 rupee plan with 2 GB of data which has to be used in 21 days.By comparison, the monthly average revenue per user for India's telecoms industry, where many still use basic phones, was 127 rupees in the quarter ended March, according to latest data available with the sector regulator.""It is definitely aggressive and will hurt the incumbents,"" said the analyst who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.

There is also growing scepticism among traders that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers such as Russia will agree to freeze production at a meeting in Algeria later this month.However, lending credence to a freeze, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, has appeared to change its stance and is likely to support production stabilization at the meeting.But further clouding the issue, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Friday played down the potential for talks on a possible output freeze.Additionally, more U.S. supply will return to the market as some producers in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico are restarting operations after Hurricane Hermine is set to make landfall.Manufacturing activities in parts of Asia, which accounts for most of the world's oil demand growth, has also slowed.""Most of Asia depends on exports, and without demand picking up in the west and on the mainland (of China), it's hard to see a sustained rebound in trade,"" HSBC economist Frederick Neumann said in a note.",9/2/2016,,

The PP has denied it has a problem with corruption, saying the cases are isolated and it is tackling them.The World Bank's 189 governors are expected to vote on Soria's candidature as part of the process of appointing 25 executive directors.The Spanish government examines the suitability of candidates based on their track record in public service as well as on their experience when selecting for international posts, the Economy Ministry said.",9/3/2016,,

business,Tax exempt military fuel sold on open market Afghani,"strong>KABUL: Tax-exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market, industry officials and a new anti-corruption report reveal, causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid.</strongAn AFP team witnessed first-hand evidence hinting at how duty-free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week.Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards, the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers, scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry.Among the documents from one driver was a ""maafinama"" -- a tax-exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around $200 a ton -- showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry.Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries -- responsible for Afghan military and police -- is exempted from custom duty, following a security agreement between the government and NATO.""What is this fuel doing in this market?"" asked the official, standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations.""That�s the big question,"" he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck, pledging a full investigation.He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasonsstrong>- �Misuse� -</strongNo commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war-ravaged Afghanistan as fuel -- and none more at risk of being stolen, smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption, observers say.Last year, more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan, the finance ministry said, with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around $100 million.""The custom duty exemption mechanism... (for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit,"" said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain ""maafinamas"" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to ""misuse"".""Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies,"" the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.""(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.""NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP�s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he ""cannot confirm nor deny"" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.strong>- �Contaminated� -</strongThe comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label ""donor fatigue"" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.""Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market,"" said the official who carried out the inspection.""How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.""The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.""MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented,"" the MEC report said.""Why not? Is the reason for the delay perhaps another instance of corruption?""",9/5/2016,,

Obama said on Sunday he ""wouldn't over-crank the significance"" of the airport events.""None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship (with China),"" he told a news conference. ""The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation.""Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou, with parts of the city of 9 million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G20 summit stays incident-free.",9/5/2016,,

The dollar, which had slumped 1.38 percent on the yen on Tuesday, shed another 0.5 percent to 101.48 yen.The yen gained additional support from a media report that the Bank of Japan's board is struggling to agree on a common front in its planned policy review.The euro maintained Tuesday's 0.96 percent rise against the dollar, the biggest daily gain in three months on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1247.A resurgent British pound rose to near eight-week high of $1.3445 on Tuesday and held firm at $1.3416.Gold rallied to $1,352.4 per ounce to near three-week highs on Tuesday, and last stood at $1,350.0.The Australian dollar took a breather. It was last down 0.2 percent at $0.7668 after GDP data largely met expectations, with Australia's annual growth clocking its fastest pace in four years last quarter, clinching a remarkable run of 25 years without recession.Oil prices kept some distance from three-week lows touched last week, maintaining a part of gains made after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on Monday to cooperate in world oil markets, saying they will not act immediately but could limit output in the future.Brent crude futures stood at $47.49 per barrel LCOc1, up 0.5 percent on the day and above its low last week of $45.32.",9/7/2016,,

Large airports are benefiting from capacity shifts where flights are being directed through major connecting hubs.But the trend toward hubs comes at the expense of smaller regional airports, which are losing out on traffic, Gittens noted.Air cargo grew more weakly than passenger traffic, rising 2.6 percent in total volume during 2015, partly because of subdued growth in emerging markets and developing economies.",9/9/2016,,

The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.""The US investment bank Goldman Sachs in April agreed to pay more than $5 billion to settle similar allegations.US authorities have accused major banks of misleading investors about the values and quality of complex mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the underlying lending was worthless or fraudulent, delivering billions of dollars in losses to holders of the mortgage bonds when the housing market collapsed, bringing down numerous banks and touching off the country�s worst recession since the 1930s.According to securities filings, Deutsche Bank as of June 30 had set aside $5.5 billion to resolve pending legal matters. In the mortgage-backed securities matter, the bank is aiming for an amount between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to knowledgeable sources.The US Justice Department declined to comment.Bank of America in 2014 paid out nearly $17 billion in a related enforcement action but federal authorities have faced stinging criticism for failing to hold individuals to account.In recent years, Deutsche Bank has found itself mired litigation and enforcement actions around the world.US market regulators last year fined the German lender $55 million, concluding that it had overvalued its holdings of credit derivatives by at least $15 billion during the financial crisis.In 2015 and 2016 Deutsche Bank failed so-called stress tests conducted by the US central bank that were designed to determine whether it had adequate capital strength to weather shocks such as those of the financial crisis.In June, the International Monetary Fund described the bank as a ""major systemic risk,"" leaving its chief executive John Cryan to strive to convince markets that Deutsche Bank was bound to recover.In April of last year, Deutsche Bank also paid a record $2.5 billion to settle American and British charges that it had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, affecting commercial interest rates.The bank also settled with the US Fed and New York�s Department of Financial Services of alleged sanctions violations in Syria and Iran.In July Deutsche Bank posted a 98 percent year-on-year drop in second-quarter profits, with net earnings recorded at only $22 million, which Cryan, the bank�s chief, attributed to ""sustained restructuring.""Cryan plans to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide by 2020, while the bank�s share price has fallen to around 10 percent of its pre-crisis value.",9/16/2016,,

business,Fed again poised to cut longer run interest rate for,"strong>SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK: U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output, productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades.</strongIt would be the fourth time in 15 months that the U.S. central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so-called neutral rate was too optimistic, raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years.The Fed, however, still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth.Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer-run rate at this week's monetary policy meeting, with the median forecast possibly falling to 2.75 percent. It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the ""shallowest"" set of rate hikes ever; ""much flatter,"" according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.""They are not very far from being in a tightening mode,"" said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. ""That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.""FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.""They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after.

business,Oil bet wrong rusting tankers rigs clog up Asian water,"strong>JOHOR, MALAYSIA: Some 15 km (9 miles) from the bustling port of Singapore, a rusting tanker as big as the world's largest aircraft carriers lies idle in a muddy estuary flanked by mangrove trees on the coast of southern Malaysia.</strongThe 340-metre (1,115 ft) ""FPSO Opportunity"", a hulking so-called Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel capable of drilling for oil in deep waters, is currently surplus to requirements along with scores of other rigs, tankers and support vessels in an era of cheap oil.The fleet of mothballed giant vessels anchored around Southeast Asian waters is the physical fallout of an oil downturn heading into its third year, and a stark reminder of how badly the industry miscalculated market conditions.""There was a misguided focus? on scarcity in the supply side from the early 2000s,"" said David Fyfe, head of research at oil and commodity trading firm Gunvor.""As an industry, they were complacent. They thought because cost was high, prices will remain high ... (but) then there was the advent of shale. Since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.""The shale revolution turned the United States into one of the world's biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the Middle East and Russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices LCOc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.The FPSO Opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by Chevron CV.N and Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) before being taken over by a Bermuda-registered FPSO Opportunity Inc in 2011. The newest owner could not be reached for comment.NEW LANDSCAPEThe growing number of vessels anchored in the Johor river estuary is changing the landscape for the locals.""I've been coming here to fish every day for 10 years, and never have there been more ships parked,"" said an angler named Aiman, sitting on an unused pipeline lying on the beach.""It is quite intimidating to come here before dawn and to find, with the first rays of sun, another big ship has been parked here,"" he added, with his line dangling in the river.And it's not just Malaysia that has become the dumping ground for idled oil equipment.Across the Singapore Strait, in the bays of Indonesia's Batam island, over a hundred oil drilling and support vessels have been sitting idle for months, or even years.While laying up ships is legal and even provides profit to specialist mothballing companies, environmental groups say the growing number adds to the risk to flora and fauna.""The idling oil tankers risk polluting the marine environment, which a sizable population of the riverine fishermen rely on for their living,"" said Vincent Chow, chairman of the Malaysian Nature Society in Johor, citing the threat of dissolving paint and potential leakage of heavy metals and fuel into the sea.strong>COST OF DOING NOTHING</strongThe armada of laid-up vessels shows how the shale boom caught the oil industry off guard and scuppered plans to drill for new fields.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said global exploration spending halved in 2015, while BMI Research sees capital expenditure among oil producers suffering another sharp decline this year.Struggling drilling companies are paying to lay up rigs in the hope they will survive until demand picks up again.The cost depends on size and location, and whether they are in a so-called ""hot lay-up"", whereby equipment is kept operational so the vessel quickly returns to service, or ""cold lay-up"" whereby ships can be mothballed for years.Cold lay-up for a rig or large oil tanker costs $20,000 to $25,000 a month in Johor, said Balasubramanian Krishna, operations manager at Malaysian lay-up specialist Ocean Shipcare, while laying-up a small supply vessel costs $3,000 to $4,000 a month.Matti Bargfried, head of marketing at maritime software company CODie, said a lay-up time of several years could make re-commissioning lengthy and costly.""The main concern here is preservation against humidity, leakage of chemicals and condition of the hull,"" he said.This means that some of the idled vessels may have to be scrapped in yards in countries such as India or Bangladesh, although shippers say the current cost of the journey may be more than their scrap value.",9/22/2016,,

Some officials have called for a renewed diplomatic offensive instead.Modi said on Saturday that India would mount a global campaign to isolate Pakistan, including through the United Nations, where Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj spoke on Monday.India has long accused Pakistan of backing militant groups operating in the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir, through which several of the countries' shared rivers flow.Pakistan denies the allegations and says India has not provided adequate proof to support its claims. A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Modi's hydropower plans.At Monday's meeting, Modi and officials discussed ways to increase exploitation of the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers but said they would not violate a long-standing water treaty between the countries in the process.""We want to see that all these (hydropower) projects are put on a really fast-track basis,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on the condition he was not named because of the sensitivity of the meeting.""Our entire approach was done to create an atmosphere of goodwill. But in this atmosphere, we want to exploit all our rights under the (Indus Water) treaty,"" the source said.The Indus Water Treaty was signed in 1960 in a bid to resolve disputes, but India's ambitious irrigation plans and construction of thousands of upstream dams has continued to annoy Pakistan, which depends on snow-fed Himalayan rivers for everything from drinking water to agriculture.India says its use of upstream water is strictly in line with the 1960 agreement.The potential for a military conflict between India and Pakistan over water has long worried observers.The neighbours have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.India currently generates about 3,000 megawatts of energy from hydropower plants along rivers in its portion of Kashmir, but believes the region has the potential to produce 18,000 megawatts, the source said.New Delhi will also review whether to restart construction of the Tulbul navigation project, which was suspended several years ago. The project proposes diverting water from one of the shared rivers to a city in Indian-administered Kashmir that could impact flows downstream, the source said.�A spokesman for Modi's office declined to comment.",9/27/2016,,

IS was again blamed by Turkish authorities.The tourism industry last year was worth $35.1 billion in revenues and it accounts for 4.4 percent of GDP in Turkey.Despite normalising ties with Moscow in June and the lifting of travel sanctions this summer, visitor numbers to Turkey from Russia fell 83.63 percent last month compared with the previous year.In August 2015, the overall number of Russian visitors was nearly 640,000 but this year�s figure for August was under 105,000, in a devastating blow to tourism on Turkey�s Mediterranean coast.However, the resumption of charter flights to Turkish resorts at the start of September could see a welcome rise in Russian visitors.Arrivals in August from the key tourism market of Germany were down 34.5 percent while arrivals from Iran -- an increasing source of tourism -- fell almost 32 percent.Saudi Arabia was the only key tourism market to see any growth with visitor numbers from the kingdom reversing the trend and doubling in August 2015.In its latest trading update Tuesday, British travel operator Thomas Cook Group said that there was strong demand for most destinations except Turkey.The operator saw a four percent slump in bookings because of Turkey where ""demand continues to be volatile"", Peter Fankhauser, the group�s chief executive, said in a statement.",9/29/2016,,

After two and a half years, OPEC reached consensus to manage the market,"" said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who had repeatedly clashed with Saudi Arabia during previous meetings.He and other ministers said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day. OPEC estimates its current output at 33.24 million bpd.""We have decided to decrease the production around 700,000 bpd,"" Zanganeh said.The move would effectively re-establish OPEC production ceilings abandoned a year ago.However, how much each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.Oil prices LCOc1 jumped more than 5 percent to trade above $48 per barrel as of 2015 GMT. Many traders said they were impressed OPEC had managed to reach a compromise after years of wrangling but others said they wanted to see the details.""This is the first OPEC deal in eight years! The cartel proved that it still matters even in the age of shale! This is the end of the �production war' and OPEC claims victory,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group.Jeff Quigley, director of energy markets at Houston-based Stratas Advisors, said the market had yet to discover who would produce what: ""I want to hear from the mouth of the Iranian oil minister that he�s not going to go back to pre-sanction levels. For the Saudis, it just goes against the conventional wisdom of what they�ve been saying."".Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that Iran, Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce ""at maximum levels that make sense"" as part of any output limits.That represents a strategy shift for Riyadh, which had said it would reduce output to ease a global glut only if every other OPEC and non-OPEC producer followed suit. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year.The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post-sanctions environment, Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since 2014 and its economy could expand by almost 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of $98 billion last year, a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.strong>OIL PRICE PRESSURES</strongSaudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than 10.7 million bpd, on par with Russia and the United States. Together, the three largest global producers extract a third of the world's oil.Iran's production has been stagnant at 3.6 million bpd in the past three months, close to pre-sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than 4 million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in.Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years, forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year.""The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years..."" said Raza Agha, chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital. ""So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi.""However, with unemployment in double digits, Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery.Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations. But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to around 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of 3.6-3.7 million bpd.Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran's output was limited by sanctions. Minister Zanganeh has said Iran wanted an output cap of close to 4 million bpd. Saudi output drops in winter when it needs less fuel than during summer, when cooling requirements spike.",9/29/2016,,

business,Oil prices surge after OPECs surprise output cut d,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices surged Thursday after the OPEC producers� group surprised the market with a deal to slash output.</strongAt the end of six hours of negotiations and weeks of horse trading, OPEC announced the plan to cut production to a level of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.47 billion, bpd in August, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.The informal meeting was held on the sidelines of an IEA meeting in a bid to stabilise prices that have been battered by a stubborn supply glut since 2014.Oil prices soared by as much as six percent following the news and extended gains in Asian trade on Thursday although at a slower pace.At around 0100 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November was up 23 cents to $47.29 and Brent crude for November added 22 cents to $48.91 a barrel.The decision to cut output caught the market offguard.Market watchers had been pessimistic about a cut or a freeze after similar efforts fell apart in April due to disagreements between OPEC majors Saudi Arabia and Iran.Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst with IG Markets said the OPEC decision was the main impetus for the price surge but said details of the deal ""sound a bit fuzzy at the moment"".""There is the possibility that OPEC managed to commit to a weak deal at this meeting that may pave the way for a more comprehensive production cut at the November meeting,"" he said in a note, referring to OPEC�s formal meeting on November 30.""A more comprehensive deal from OPEC and Russia at the November meeting would easily clear the way for WTI oil to trade around US$55.""Nicholson also said official data showing a fall in the weekly US commercial crude inventories helped to boost the market.The US Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stocks in the world�s top oil consumer fell by 1.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of three million barrels.A decline in crude stocks signals stronger consumption and is positive for oil prices.""This has now been four straight weeks of back-to-back declines in crude oil inventories, which is also very supportive of the spot price,"" Nicholson said.",9/29/2016,,

business,Pakistan require lower sulphur diesel fuel starting 2017,"strong>SINGAPORE: Pakistan will lower the sulphur content of diesel imports from January next year, in line with a global shift toward cleaner fuels, said two sources familiar with the matter.</strongAs vehicle numbers in Asia have surged, countries across the region, including China, India and Vietnam, have adopted more stringent sulphur requirements for their fuels in recent years to cap emissions.Pakistan will require diesel fuel with 500 parts per million (ppm) sulphur starting from January 2017 from the current 5,000 ppm sulphur gasoil, the sources said this week.Pakistan and Indonesia are some of the few remaining Asian countries still using high-sulphur gasoil.With the shift, the South Asian nation will be on par in terms of sulphur standards with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar.State-owned Pakistan State Oil Co (PSO), the country's largest oil products importer, could not be immediately reached for comment.But the country's refineries are still not completely ready to meet the change in sulphur standards, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.About 40 percent of Pakistan's refineries have upgraded their units to produce the low sulphur diesel while the remaining refineries are still working to finish units to reduce the amount of sulphur in the fuel, the source said.The country's refineries use outdated hydro-skimming equipment and desperately need updating, only surviving due to a favourable tax regime, Pakistan's petroleum minister told Reuters last year.PSO has a long-standing term contract with Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) to import about 2.2 to 2.5 million tonnes of high sulphur gasoil every year.KPC has agreed to supply diesel with 500 ppm sulphur to PSO from next year, the two sources close to the matter said.PSO rarely imports gasoil in the spot market except for summer when it needs the fuel for power generation. So, the shift in sulphur specification is not expected to have a major impact on trade flows, middle distillates traders said.Pakistan is also moving towards 92-octane gasoline from November and is phasing out imports of 87-octane gasoline, one of the sources said.PSO is looking to potentially sign long-term contracts for gasoline cargoes, though this is not firm, the source added.

business,Oil hits highest since June on possible US inventory dr,"strong>LONDON: Oil prices rose towards $52 a barrel on Wednesday, hitting their highest level since June, supported by an industry report that U.S. inventories probably fell for a fifth straight week and OPEC's supply cut deal.</strongThe American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories dropped 7.6 million barrels, which would be the fifth straight weekly decline if confirmed by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on Wednesday.Brent crude was trading at $51.70 a barrel, up 83 cents, at 0819 GMT. The global benchmark touched $51.72 during the session, its highest since June 10. U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.",10/5/2016,,
business,Oil prices ease June highs weaker physical mar,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil futures dipped on Thursday after Saudi Arabia trimmed the price of its flagship crude to Asia, but were still near more than three-month highs following a drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at $49.55 per barrel at 0544 GMT, down 28 cents or 0.6 percent from their last settlement.International Brent futures were down 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $51.58 per barrel.Both contracts hit their highest levels since June on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stockpiles fell 3 million barrels last week to 499.74 million barrels. Despite the drawdowns, stocks were still close to all-time highs.Traders pointed to profit taking following recent price rises and said Thursday's fall also reflected weaker physical crude after top exporter Saudi Arabia cut the price of its Arab Light crude to Asian customers for November in a sign that the global fuel supply overhang persists.Another potential cap on prices comes from the United States.Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said that at around $50 a barrel for WTI, U.S. shale drillers, who have spent much of the year cutting back unprofitable production amid low prices, may start bringing back mothballed rigs.Overall, however, most analysts said that the market was well supported at current levels, especially because of a planned output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).There were also risks of forced supply disruptions, especially in North Africa, Nigeria, and Venezuela.""Oil prices seem headed for higher levels in the coming period,"" Global Risk Management said in its quarterly report this week, pointing to the risk of ""several oil producing countries struggling to increase or even keep production at current levels due to unrest/oil facility wreckages and lack of industry investments"".Barring such a disuption, most analysts did not expect prices to shoot up much further as production will remain high even with an OPEC cut, and plenty of fuel remains in stock.""Resilient production in the U.S. and Russia will postpone crude market rebalancing and keep the market in surplus into 2017,"" BMI Research said in a note to clients, even cutting its price forecast for next year.""With an insufficient demand response to counteract strong supply, the result is a downward revision of our 2017 Brent forecast to $55 per barrel from $57 per barrel,"" BMI said.",10/6/2016,,

business,Indian cotton exports Pakistan slump tensions trader,"strong>MUMBAI/KARACHI: Rising hostilities between India and Pakistan have brought their $822 million-a-year trade in cotton to a juddering halt, as traders who are worried about uncertainty over supplies and driven by patriotism hold off signing new deals.</strongThe nuclear-armed rivals have seen tensions ratchet up in the past few months over the disputed territory of Kashmir, and cotton traders in both countries said they were watching developments along the de facto border with alarm.Pakistan, the world's third-largest cotton consumer, usually starts importing from September, but three Indian exporters said the number of inquiries had slowed to a trickle in the last two weeks.In the clearest sign yet of souring relations affecting commerce, Pakistan-based importers also said they were not buying.""At the moment there is no cotton trade. It's at standstill. There is uncertainty that, God forbid, if war breaks out, what will happen?"" said Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.Pakistan Cotton Commissioner Khalid Abdullah said a ""low quantum of trade activity is still taking place.""He said the Pakistan government had not directed traders to stop buying Indian cotton and expected trade to normalize when tensions eased.Indian government officials said they had not yet noticed trading had stopped.But some Indian officials said last week that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was considering whether it should choke trade with Pakistan to put pressure on its neighbour, even though the trade balance is in India's favour.strong>INDIA'S BIGGEST COTTON BUYER</strongTrade between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since their independence from British rule in 1947, is small.In the 2015/16 fiscal year ending on March 31, official trade between the two was $2.6 billion. Cotton is the largest component of that total.It is not clear whether other goods and commodities traded between the two, such as jewellery and dry fruits, have been hit by the escalation in hostilities as well, but the disruption to cotton shipments is potentially significant.In the crop year ended Sept. 30, Pakistan was India's biggest cotton buyer after its own crop was hit by drought and whitefly pest.It imported 2.5 million bales from India, and supported Indian cotton prices at a time when China was cutting imports, traders said.Lower purchases by Pakistan this year could hurt exports from the world's biggest producer of the fibre and put pressure on Indian prices, but could also help rival cotton suppliers like Brazil, the United States and some African countries.Chirag Patel, chief executive officer of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers, said the country could export 5 million bales in the 2016/17 crop year, but exports could plunge to 3 million bales without Pakistani imports.An exporter based in Mumbai estimated that Pakistan will need to import at least 3 million bales in 2016/17, and India will have a surplus of around 8 million bales.""As soon as the (political) situation improves, cotton trade will definitely resume between the two countries,"" said Haq of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.But for now, traders on both sides of the border said the environment was not conducive to doing business.""Many cotton exporters are not interested in selling cotton to Pakistan. They are trying to find other markets,"" said Pradeep Jain, a ginner based in Jalgaon in the western state of Maharashtra.Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, referred to a move by the Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA), a small filmmakers' body, last week, banning their members from hiring Pakistani actors.""India is banning Pakistani artists, so how can it expect us to buy cotton from India?"" Khan said.""In various forums Pakistani traders are saying they will not buy cotton from India this year. Even if they need to pay extra, they will pay and buy it from other suppliers.""",10/8/2016,,
business,Putin says Russia ready to join OPEC oil output curb,"ISTANBUL: President Vladimir Putin on Monday said non-OPEC member Russia was ready to work with the cartel in imposing measures to limit oil production, in comments that propelled the price of crude to its highest levels in a a year.Eyes have turned to Russia, the world�s top oil producer alongside Saudi Arabia, to see if it will join in a concerted effort alongside cartel members to prop up prices after OPEC last month agreed a surprise output cut in the hope of lifting rock-bottom prices.Putin said at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul that such coordinated output curbs were the only way to balance the market after a prolonged period of low prices.In response, Brent North Sea crude rose $1.53 to $53.45 a barrel, the highest level reached since October 2015.""In the current situation, we believe a freeze or a cutting of the production of oil is the only way preserve the stability of the energy sector and accelerate a rebalancing of the market,"" Putin said.""Russia is prepared to join joint measures limiting production and calls on other exporting countries to do the same,"" he added.He expressed hope this would lead to a concrete agreement at a November OPEC meeting and that this idea would be a ""positive signal to the market and investors"".Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak is expected to attend an informal meeting of OPEC energy ministers in Istanbul on Wednesday in a sign of increasingly tight cooperation with the cartel.The period of low oil prices has been hugely damaging to economies like Russia which has failed over the last years to reduce its dependence on hydrocarbon exports for revenues.Putin raised alarm that if the current trend of low prices continued, it could lead to a ""chronic"" lack of financing in the sector which could in turn lead to unpredictable flare-ups in prices.""Russia as prominent energy power will always make its contribution to stable development,"" he said, insisting that even in the current difficult times Russia was still investing in oil extraction.Putin is making his first trip to Turkey following a crisis sparked by the shooting down of a Russian war plane over the Syrian border last November. He will later hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The energy minister of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, whose assent allowed the output cut to go ahead, meanwhile expressed cautious optimism the price of crude could rise to $60 dollars a barrel by the end of the year.",10/10/2016,,
business,Contract theory earns pair Nobel Economics Priz,"STOCKHOLM: Two US-based academics won the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday for groundbreaking research on contract theory that has helped design insurance policies, executive pay and even prison management.Oliver Hart, a British-American economist, and Bengt Holmstrom of Finland ""have developed contract theory, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities,"" the Nobel jury said.Their pioneering work has laid ""an intellectual foundation"" for designing policies and institutions in many areas, it added.Working separately, the two created tools to help determine whether teachers, healthcare workers, and prison guards should receive fixed salaries or performance-based pay, and whether providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, or prisons, should be publicly or privately owned.""The new theoretical tools created by Hart and Holmstrom are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design.""Hart, born in 1948, is an economics professor at Harvard University in the United States, while Holmstrom, 67, is a professor of economics and management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The pair will share the eight million kronor (826,000 euros, $924,000) prize.""My first action was to hug my wife, wake up my younger son ... and I actually spoke to my fellow laureate,"" Hart told the Nobel Foundation website.Holmstrom meanwhile told reporters via video link at the Nobel press conference in Stockholm that he was ""very surprised, and very happy"" to win the prestigious award.Holmstrom is known for his research into how contracts and incentives affect corporate behaviour including governance, as well as liquidity problems in financial crises.",10/10/2016,,

business,World Banks top economist tipped for Nob,"strong>STOCKHOLM: The World Bank�s new chief economist is among those tipped to win the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday, as the awards season moves into a second week.</strongThe economics prize is unique among the Nobel awards in that it was created by the Swedish central bank in 1968 -- the others were all set up through the 1895 will of Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.This year, economists working on growth and labour markets are among those vying for the prize, which will be announced on Monday at 11:45 am (0945 GMT).The committee has a tendency to honour pairs or trios of economists, although last year a single laureate, US-British researcher Angus Deaton, was chosen for his groundbreaking work on poverty.Paul Romer -- the US academic, activist and entrepreneur who was appointed chief economist of the World Bank in July -- is favourite to win, according to Sweden�s Dagens Nyheterm newspaper, for his pioneering work on endogenous growth theory.This relatively new area of research tries to incorporate the way that people innovate and develop technologies into models of economic growth.Romer�s employers are certainly rooting for him: last week New York University�s Stern Business School, where he teaches, accidentally published a press release naming him as the winner and inviting journalists to a news conference.The school hastily withdrew the statement and apologised, saying it was merely preparing for a possible win and that it had been published accidentally. ""We are deeply sorry that these routine preparations may appear presumptuous,"" it said.Other names circulating include 94-year-old William Baumol of the US, a labour market specialist, and Indian-born US economist Jagdish Bhagwati, a free trade researcher.Bhagwati has played ""a large if subtle role in keeping protectionism from being respectable,"" according to the 2008 Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman.Of the 76 economics prize laureates, Americans dominate the list overwhelmingly, with 55 winners.If the Nobel committee were to look elsewhere this year, it could set its sights on France�s Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the IMF, or Swedish professor and ex-central banker Lars E.O. Svensson for his work on monetary policy./><strong>- �Time for a woman� -</strong�Still more Americans have been named as possible winners: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their work on financial panic models, or Robert Townsend for his work on risk and insurance in developing economies.Michael Woodford, a monetary theorist currently teaching at Columbia University, and Robert Barro, who researches the factors that determine economic growth, are also mentioned as serious candidates.Women remain largely absent from the list of economics laureates. Only one woman has won the prize -- Elinor Ostrom, in 2009.But French-American Esther Duflo, 43, would be an ideal laureate, according to economist Micael Dahlen, interviewed in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.""It�s high time for a woman to get the prize, for someone under the age of retirement to get it, and because her research is groundbreaking in the fields of poverty and economics, among other things,"" he said.The economics prize is the fifth of the six Nobel prizes to be announced this year.Last week, the awards for medicine, physics, and chemistry were announced, as well as the peace prize, which went to Colombia�s President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end a half-century war with the FARC rebels.The final prize, for literature, will be announced Thursday.For that award, the Swedish Academy could tap a superstar novelist such as Philip Roth of the US or Haruki Murakami of Japan, or a lesser-known writer such as Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse or Syrian poet Adonis.The Nobel prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and cheque for eight million Swedish kronor (828,000 euros, $928,000), which the laureates will receive at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.�",10/10/2016,,

They were trading 0.1 percent lower at $51.28 at 0022 GMT.The gains came after Russia said it was ready to join the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in limiting crude output and Algeria called for similar commitments from other non-OPEC producers.OPEC aims for agreements to cut about 700,000 barrels per day in its first reduction in eight years.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent.Japan's Nikkei .N225 added 0.8 percent.South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.1 percent after opening lower as Samsung Electronics plunged by much as 5 percent as the company struggles to contain a deepening crisis over its Galaxy Note7 phone.Samsung told customers on Tuesday to stop using their Note7 smartphones while it investigated reports of fires in the devices.The world's top smartphone maker said it had asked all global carriers to stop sales of the Note7 and to stop providing replacements while it worked with regulators to investigate the problem.Overnight, U.S. stock indexes closed up between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, after the pan-European FTEU3 index ended the day 0.9 percent higher.""The oil market news proved immensely positive for equities,"" Angus Nicholson, market analyst at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.The dollar retained overnight gains on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.Traders have priced in a 70 percent chance that the Fed will hike at a Dec. 13-14 policymakers' meeting, up from 66 percent early Friday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Investors are looking to Wednesday's release of minutes of the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting to see how close the Fed was to hiking rates last month.The U.S. dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to 103.95 yen in early Asian trade on Tuesday, after rising 0.7 percent on Monday.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, added 0.1 percent to 96.989 in early Asian trade, after climbing 0.3 percent on Monday.The Mexican peso strengthened more than 2 percent on Monday against the U.S. dollar, which fell to a one-month low of 18.795 pesos after the second presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

business,External sharia audits gain traction in Islamic finance study find,"strong>KUALA LUMPUR: External sharia audits are gaining support in Islamic finance as consumers and regulators seek more transparency and accountability, a study has found.</strongIslamic banks have traditionally used in-house boards of scholars to determine whether religious principles are being obeyed, but this self-policing has often been criticised for leaving banks open to conflicts of interest.Pressure for more external oversight has been building in several countries that have major Islamic finance industries, and this year Bahrain's central bank proposed new governance rules that would require Islamic banks there to conduct external sharia audits.The study, published this week by the Malaysia-based International Shariah Research Academy for Islamic Finance and Britain's UK Islamic Finance Council (UKIFC), said external sharia audits should become mandatory globally, and that this would help the growth of Islamic finance.""By providing an additional check, external sharia audit will play an important role towards providing reassurance to scholars, financial institutions and customers,"" said Omar Shaikh, advisory board member of the UKIFC, a body which seeks to develop the industry.The Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), whose standards are followed in many countries, is deliberating whether to incorporate external sharia audits as a separate item in its rules, the study said.""If AAOIFI make it part of their standards, then all countries where their standards are mandatory will naturally start implementation,"" said Shaikh, adding that support for such external audits had also come from banks in Kuwait.The central bank of Oman issued specific guidelines for external sharia audits in 2012, and Pakistan's central bank did so in 2014.Malaysia, the top Islamic finance market in Asia, does not specify a position on external sharia audits but existing practice by the central bank includes an extensive sharia inspection of all Islamic financial institutions every year.The study suggested that to help national regulators introduce external sharia audits, the scope of the audits should be made clear, results should be publicly disclosed and there should be conflict resolution mechanisms.",10/12/2016,,
business,Oil edges up on record Indian imports hopes of producer cu,"strong>TOKYO: Oil prices edged up on Wednesday, supported by record Indian crude imports and upcoming talks between OPEC producers and other oil exporters on curbing output to end a glut in the global market.</strongBrent crude futures were up 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $52.62 a barrel at 0639 GMT.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement at $50.94 per barrel.Traders said that prices were boosted by record Indian oil imports.India's oil imports rose 4.4 percent in September from the previous month to a record high 4.47 million barrels per day (bpd) as the country expanded its refining capacity to meet growing fuel demand in an expanding economy, shipping data showed.Oil imports by the world's third biggest oil consumer surged 17.7 percent from a year ago, according to ship tracking data and a report compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.The prospect of countries from oil group OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia coordinating a production cut to rein in global oversupply, also supported prices.However, analysts cautioned that a deal might still fall through especially as Russia's participation remained uncertain.Much would depend on the timing of any production cut, said Alan Gelder, vice president for refining, chemicals and oil markets at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which could deter participation.""Timing is key for Russia to provide non-OPEC support to re-balancing the oil market, as September was, momentarily, at unprecedented production levels. The production reference (month) could require Rosneft to curb its current drilling programme, which is contrary to the interests of its private shareholders,"" he said.Oil has rallied more than 13 percent in less than two weeks since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed its first production curbs in eight years. But prices remain at about half of mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel as questions remain over when the market will return to balance.Goldman Sachs added its doubts on Tuesday, saying in a research note that the planned oil output cut by OPEC and other exporters has become a ""greater possibility,"" but warned a production cut likely won't be deep enough to re-balance markets in 2017, and that oil prices may fall back into the low $40s per barrel.",10/12/2016,,

They are worth $13.6 billion,""Abdul Matlub Ahmad, head of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), told AFP.Ahmad said the deals reflect Dhaka�s improving security situation after Bangladesh launched a deadly crackdown on extremists following an attack on a posh restaurant in the capital in which suspected militants killed 22, mostly foreign hostages.""The agreements send a positive signal to the rest of the world that Bangladesh is a safe haven as an investment destination. The Chinese investors are satisfied with the security situation here,"" he added.The deals were signed after the FBCCI, Bangladesh�s top trade and business lobbyist group, and the China Council for Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) organised a two-day tete-e-tete between business officials of both nations on the sidelines of Xi�s tour.""We will invest in investment parks.

We are confident that Russia will reflect upon our concerns,"" Saran said.But Putin is seen as unlikely to weigh into the dispute between the rivals, as Moscow also eyes closer defence ties with Islamabad.

""It�ll end up costing them a lot more than what they gain in visa payments.""Higher visa fees are one of many moves adopted by the kingdom to cover a loss in oil revenue which has slumped by 68 percent over the past five years, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News.But the higher cost of entry permits has left people ""scratching their heads"", a second diplomat said.""We are expecting to see business reconsider Saudi as a market,"" said the Western envoy. ""It�s certainly happening already,"" though not in a major way.Starting in October, a six-month business or work-visit visa allowing multiple entries costs 3,000 riyals ($800), compared with 400 riyals before, said Ala Siyam, general manager of Gulf Consulting House.The consultancy, in Khobar on the Gulf coast, assists clients from more than 40 countries in securing visas to Saudi Arabia, which requires all foreigners to have a local sponsor, whether to visit on holiday or business.Siyam told AFP the changes do not apply to the European Union or United States, while fees for British nationals have only slightly increased.Most other countries face the higher charges but also have a new option of applying for one or two-year visas. Those cost 5,000 riyals and 8,000 riyals each.Single-entry business visas are now priced at 2,000 riyals, several times higher than before.An oil industry source called the new tariffs ""crazy"" and a ""complete mistake"" if Saudi Arabia was seeking foreign partnerships.Since 2014, global oil prices have collapsed by about half, accelerating Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income.In April, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, announced a ""Vision 2030"" reform programme to transform the world�s biggest oil exporter into a private-sector powerhouse with diverse industrial interests and major international investments.- Looking elsewhere -To promote job creation among Saudis and boost exports, Vision 2030 aims to foster small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) partly through ""international partnerships"".""This will be achieved by attracting both regional and international retail investors"", the Vision says.But higher visa fees will be a ""particular disincentive for SMEs"", including those wanting to assess the market or meet potential partners, the first diplomat said.He and the Western diplomat agreed that foreign companies will now be more likely to consider doing business, and even meeting, elsewhere.Abdulrahman al-Zamil, former chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers, says the impact of the hike in visa fees is being exaggerated.""Most of those who are interested in our market.. can afford it. These are giant companies,"" said the head of Zamil Group, which employs 21,000 people in a range of sectors including steel fabrication and shipbuilding.""The Saudi market is not really attractive to small and medium"" enterprises from abroad, Zamil added.Siyam, whose company secured about 5,000 visas last year, predicted a small fall in the number of business visitors, with only non-essential staff left out of delegations.""This country, it�s a very important country, so I think those who want to come, they will still come,"" he said.",10/21/2016,,

Last month, militants that New Delhi claims came from across the border attacked an army base in Uri in the state, killing 19 soldiers.Pakistan, the world's third-largest cotton consumer, usually starts importing from September, but exporters said the number of inquiries had slowed to a trickle in the last few weeks.In 2015/16, Pakistan surpassed Bangladesh to become India's biggest cotton buyer and accounted for 40 percent of exports.India has so far in the season contracted 500,000 bales for export as demand was weak from overseas buyers, Dhiren Sheth, president of the Cotton Association of India, said.By this time last year, Indian traders had signed contracts to export 1 million bales, dealers said.India's cotton output in 2016/17 could rise 3.8 percent from a year earlier to 35.1 million bales as yields are expected to increase due to good monsoon rains, Gupta said.""This year, area under cotton was lower but due to good monsoon rains and less impact from pests, we are estimating higher per-hectare yields,"" she said.(1 Indian bale = 170 kg)",10/25/2016,,

Some of them have actually led into concrete agreements and compacts with the Iranian side,"" he told reporters, adding that there was still ""a lot of potential"" for further investment talks.Despite the lifting of nuclear-linked sanctions, the United States and the European Union still impose penalties against Iran over its support for armed movements, ballistic missile programme and human rights record.Iran provides financial and military support to Lebanon�s Shiite militia Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamist groups, considered by some Western countries as terrorist organisations.",10/26/2016,,

However, Afghanistan and Pakistan, stipulate additional hurdles for women entrepreneurs.�This year, New Zealand has edged out Singapore as the easiest country for doing business in the latest rankings.The World Bank cited reductions in labor-related taxes and new regulations that make paying taxes easier as key reasons for moving New Zealand to the top spot from its previous runner-up position.Macedonia broke into the coveted top 10, while Brunei had the biggest improvement, moving to 72nd from a rank of 84th last year as it made electricity supply more reliable, passed a new insolvency law and increased protections for minority investors.According to the report, a record 137 economies made reforms to make it easier to start and operate businesses in the last year, with more than 75 percent of the changes occurring in developing countries.Kazakhstan rose to 35th place from 41st, with big weight given to its improvements in business start-up regulations, construction permits and power availability. Rounding out the 10 most-improved countries were Kenya, Belarus, Indonesia, Serbia, Georgia, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.This year's report tracked gender differences in scores for starting a business, registering property and enforcing contracts, finding discrimination that lowered the scores of 38 economies. Twenty-three of those had more procedures for women than men to start a business, and 16 limited women's ability to own and transfer property.The 184th-ranked Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, requires a married woman to have her husband's authorization to incorporate a business, the study said.The World Bank says better performance in the ""Doing Business"" rankings generally equates to lower levels of income inequality and reduced poverty.""Simple rules that are easy to follow are a sign that a government treats its citizens with respect,"" the World Bank's chief economist, Paul Romer, said in a statement. ""They yield direct economic benefits - more entrepreneurship, more market opportunities for women, more adherence to the rule of law.""Most of the top 10 shifted around a bit, with Denmark staying in third place, Hong Kong edging higher to fourth from fifth, trading places with South Korea, and Norway rising to sixth.

""But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.""Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.""The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide.",10/27/2016,,

""I think this is one case where people are paring back on their risk.""Wall Street is thought to generally favor Clinton over Trump for president, and equity markets have hovered at historically high levels since July, with the S&amp;P 500 less than three percent below its all-time peak.Clinton is considered the more market-friendly outcome, expected to maintain the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, while the market views Trump as a great unknown, both because of his penchant for controversy and his lack of a record in public office.Trump has attacked trade partners China and Mexico and accused Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of being a political tool of the Democratic party. Investors are also unsettled by Trump�s seeming embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a sign he may take foreign policy in radical new directions.Signs of nervousness have been seen in certain trades, analysts say, like the Mexican peso. Trump�s pledge of immigration controls and trade restrictions with Mexico have raised worries over its economy.The peso sank against the dollar as Trump�s campaign added momentum, but then rebounded on Clinton�s gains following the first presidential debate on September 26.But it remains down about 9 percent since Trump secured his party�s nomination in May.On the other hand, another gauge of market sentiment has been the biotechnology sector, which is seen as vulnerable in a Clinton presidency given the Democrat�s vow to address runaway drug prices. The Nasdaq biotechnology index has fallen about nine percent over the last month.Some analysts say the markets have already assumed a Clinton victory.""To me, the markets clearly want a Clinton win and they have priced that in,"" said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management.""That�s what they predict, and that�s what they want. If that doesn�t happen, I feel there�s a great level of uncertainty and possible downside to the markets.""strong>- Some �complacency� over Trump -</strongIndeed, investors are aware that Trump has been consistently underestimated by the political, media and business establishment. Many are also loath to repeat the error of Britain�s June referendum to leave the European Union, when polling supported the market bet on a ""stay"" vote, only to be thrown into turmoil when Brexit passed.""There�s a bit of complacency in the market."" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management,""I think the market�s underestimating the possibility of things going wrong as a result of either a Trump victory or the possibility of internal strife in the nation as a result of Clinton winning,"" she said.Briefing.com analyst Patrick O�Hare cited sluggish trading volume, as well as the flatness of the S&amp;P 500, as a sign investors are in ""seeing is believing mode"" with respect to polls pointing to a Clinton triumph.One sign of a pickup in caution is the VIX volatility index, also known as the ""fear"" index. The index has risen the last three days and jumped nearly 8 percent Thursday to 15.36. Still, that is far below the 25.76 level on the day after the Brexit shock.A big jump in the VIX before November 8 would signal ""that the market is fearing something odd,"" Kinahan said.",10/28/2016,,

JD Power and LMC Automotive predicted a 0.8 percent slide year-over-year in sales, still close to all-time highs.""We do not foresee a large pullback in sales in the near term, but the fact that retail sales are beginning to contract, despite high incentives and extremely low interest rates and gas prices, is a clear indicator that this cycle has reached its peak,"" JD Power senior automotive analyst John Humphrey said in a statement.",11/1/2016,,

They plunged nearly 4 percent to $46.86 a barrel in the previous session.Brent for January delivery, the new front-month contract, was up 45 cents at $49.06 a barrel.

The cartel said members' cuts will be finalised at a meeting later this month.Still, OPEC approved a document on Monday outlining its long-term strategy that would mean returning to its role of managing the market and being more proactive in anticipating market changes.That was a more bullish signal after OPEC representatives met on Friday in Vienna, and then again on Saturday with their counterparts from non-member producers, but failed to reach any specific terms, and sources said Iran has been reluctant to even freeze output.""The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between OPEC producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on November 30,"" Goldman Sachs said in a research note.Kazakhstan has no plans to reduce oil output despite attending the meetings of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Tuesday.Bozumbayev told reporters the giant Kashagan field, where global majors are about to begin commercial output, would be the main driver of output growth and limiting Kashagan's production would not be possible.�OPEC's oil output likely hit a record high in October, rising to 33.82 million barrels per day as Nigeria and Libya partially resumed output after disruptions and Iraq raised overseas sales, according to a Reuters survey.",11/1/2016,,

business,Pakistan shippers fume as containers hijacked to block pr,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistani business leaders complained Wednesday of losing millions of dollars to the government�s novel way of containing protesters: by confiscating thousands of shipping containers, many still full of goods, to block roads.</strongTransport operators complained that up to 4,000 containers had been diverted from their usual route between the southern port city of Karachi and Islamabad to block the capital�s roads this week, as opposition leader Imran Khan threatened a million-strong demonstration to lock down the government.By Tuesday Khan had called the protest off, but the containers -- many carrying medicines, perishable goods and other costly cargo -- had not yet been returned.""A great injustice is being done to us as authorities have seized more than 4,000 containers carrying goods,"" Chaudhry Saeed Iqbal, vice chairman of the Karachi-based Pakistan Transport Federation, told AFP.Zafar Bakhtawri, vice president of the Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries, estimated the losses at ""millions"" of dollars.He pointed out that the move also brings factories, where storage space is limited when production cannot be shipped out, to a halt.Babar Chaudhry, a local transport operator, said he had to pay fines each time his shipments fall behind schedule. ""We have been urging government and held several meetings with authorities... but so far they have not stopped this practice,"" Chaudhry told AFP.Government officials were not immediately available for comment.- Crowd control -The sight of containers in the streets have become an ubiquitous sign of stirring unrest in major cities since the tactic was first used in Karachi in 2007.Then, the government of General (retired) Pervez Musharraf sealed the megacity with containers to stop sacked chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry from addressing fellow lawyers.The next ""containerisation"", as the tactic is becoming known, came later that same year, when current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to return from exile in Saudi Arabia. He landed at Islamabad airport but was deported immediately on a special plane.The city of Rawalpindi, where Islamabad airport is situated, was locked down with containers in preparation.Since then containers have been freely used to control crowds, even those on routine religious marches.Containers are also used to create stages at political rallies and temporary residences and offices for leaders -- though in those cases they are usually paid for by the parties concerned.In 2014 Imran Khan joined forces with populist cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri to bring thousands of protesters to Islamabad for a sit-in outside parliament.The pair turned the government�s use of containers on its head: first, by embracing them as mobile offices, each having their own fully-equipped air-conditioned container with toilets, wifi and television.They also brought their own cranes and simply removed containers -- even those filled with earth and sand -- positioned by authorities to block their path to the high-security Red Zone in front of Parliament House.",11/2/2016,,
business,Hillary Clinton Wall Street favorite enemy,"strong>WASHINGTON: Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in Wall Street.</strongBoosted by Wall Street's toughest critics, U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate has declared ""the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top"" and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations. She has encouraged regulators to break up too-risky banks.And yet, Wall Street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a Clinton presidency. In fact, the banking industry has supported Clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the Clinton campaign stumbles. Privately, bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in 2010.�I don�t think Clinton wakes up thinking about Wall Street,"" one senior banking industry lobbyist said.There are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among Clinton's campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly.Pressed during the campaign by progressive Democrats to call for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking, Clinton ultimately refused. She also weighed another progressive favorite - a tax on financial transactions- but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders.Ultimately, what bankers most like about Clinton is that she is not Donald Trump.Many financiers fear her unorthodox Republican rival could disrupt global trade, damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets, industry analysts and participants say.�Those are the kind of things that corner offices think about,� said Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc, whose firm advises financial firms about U.S. regulatory policy. �The overriding concern about Trump has dominated people�s thinking.""Trump's candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the Republicans have been flinging money at Clinton.Employees of the 17 largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her $10 for every $1 they contributed to Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. In 2012, the same group contributed twice as much to Republican candidate Mitt Romney as it did to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.strong>DEVIL YOU KNOW</strongPeople who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than $56 million to Clinton�s presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations. Trump�s campaign and related groups received just $243,000 from donors in the same sector, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.�It�s basically going with the devil you know over the devil you don�t,� said Brian Gardner, a managing director of New York investment firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. What also helped, he said, was the familiarity with Hillary and Bill Clinton dating back to the 1990s when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation.�There is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on Wall Street and the Clintons,"" he said.For bankers, the biggest worry is a scenario where Clinton wins and the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, with progressives such as Warren and Sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators.Already, Warren has called for immediate dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. Last year, Warren successfully led a movement to derail Obama�s plan to appoint banker Antonio Weiss to the top job at Treasury.Warren and other progressives will press Clinton to be tough on Wall Street in return for their campaign support.Clinton ""leaned heavily on Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and progressive ideas, when she needed to excite voters,� Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said. �Elizabeth Warren has proven she�s a very powerful ally to have on your side. And it�s well known she�s also a formidable opponent to have against you,� Green said.However, recent polls suggest it is unlikely that Democrats will take the House and the future of the Senate is far from certain. Even if the Senate goes Democratic, it is likely to be led by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a moderate who has represented Wall Street with the industry's backing.Clinton has said she will propose a ""risk fee"" on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds. Like Trump, she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy, termed ""carried interest.""Yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months, if not a year or more, of horse trading in Washington. Ultimately, it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals, such as infrastructure funding, college affordability, or raising the minimum wage.Those are the causes that Clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti-bank rhetoric, say bankers. One industry trade group representative said: ""We're not in her top 10 to take care of.""",11/2/2016,,

He also argued that a contested election would be the worst outcome for the greenback, sending it to $1.14.Markets have tended to see Clinton as the status quo candidate, and news favoring her bid has tended to boost global risk appetite - a positive for the dollar and other higher-yielding currencies against the euro, yen and Swiss franc.The biggest loser, conversely, due to Trump's stance on immigration, foreign policy and trade has been the Mexican peso, at one point in September down as much as 17 percent against the dollar since the businessman won the nomination.The peso gained more than 2 percent to 18.62 per dollar in early trade in Europe.

Opinion polls before Election Day had given Clinton a slim lead.Mexico's peso plunged to its lowest-ever levels as Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. Concerns of a Trump victory have weighed heavily on the peso for months because of his threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay to build a wall on the southern U.S. border.Trump surged to wins in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina, and Fox News projected a win for him in Wisconsin. With voting completed in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, he also narrowly led in Michigan and New Hampshire, edging him closer to 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the state-by-state fight for the White House.Shortly after Fox called Wisconsin for Trump, supporters at his election evening rally in New York began to chant ""Lock her up"" - a common refrain on the campaign trail for the former U.S. secretary of state repeatedly dubbed ""Crooked Hillary"" by Trump.Clinton still had ways to reach 270 electoral votes, but she would have to sweep the remaining battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada, and pull off an upset win in Arizona.Trump captured conservative states in the South and Midwest, while Clinton swept several states on the East Coast and Illinois in the Midwest.After running close throughout the night in Virginia, Clinton pulled out the swing state that is home to her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine. But TrumpAt 8:55 p.m. EST, Clinton acknowledged a battle that was unexpectedly tight given her edge in opinion polls going into Election Day.She tweeted: ""This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything.""As of 11:40 p.m. EST, Trump had 244 electoral votes to Clinton�s 209, with U.S. television networks projecting the winner in 41 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to challenge Clinton, whose gold-plated establishment resume includes stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state.strong>UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES</strongBoth candidates had historically low popularity ratings, although Trump's were worse than Clinton's, in an election that many voters characterized as a choice between two unpleasant alternatives.Before Tuesday's voting, Clinton led Trump, 44 percent to 39 percent in the last Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll. A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll gave her a 90 percent chance of defeating Trump and becoming the first woman elected U.S. president.Also at stake on Tuesday was control of Congress. Television networks projected Republicans would retain control of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats were up for grabs.In the Senate, where Republicans were defending a slim four-seat majority, Democrats scored their first breakthrough in Illinois when Republican Senator Mark Kirk lost re-election. But Republicans Rob Portman in Ohio and Marco Rubio in Florida won high-profile Senate re-election fights.In a presidential campaign that focused more on the character of the candidates than on policy, Clinton, 69, and Trump, 70, accused each other of being fundamentally unfit to lead the country.Trump entered the race 17 months ago and survived a series of seemingly crippling blows, many of them self-inflicted, including the emergence in October of a 2005 video in which he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women. He apologized but within days, several women emerged to say he had groped them, allegations he denied.He was judged the loser of all three presidential debates with Clinton and she led him by varying margins for months in opinion polls.Trump won avid support among a core base of white non-college educated workers with his promise to be the ""greatest jobs president that God ever created."" He has vowed to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods exported to the United States by U.S. companies that went abroad.His volatile nature and unorthodox proposals led to campaign feuds with a long list of people, including Muslims, the disabled, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, the family of a slain Muslim-American soldier, a Miss Universe winner and a federal judge of Mexican heritage.",11/9/2016,,

business,World Bank praises Pak progress restoring macroeconomic stability,"strong>WASHINGTON: A new World Bank report has praised Pakistan continuing progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, saying it was ready to support the government�s reforms agenda to help spread its benefits more widely.</strong�After achieving macroeconomic stability, the government continued to deliver on its structural reform agenda in FY16, but much remains to be done if growth is to be strengthened and sustained,� the report said.The �Pakistan Development Update� report which is released twice a year, noted 4.7 economic growth in 2015-16 financial year, being the highest in eight years and projected the growth to accelerate to 5.4 percent in FY18, according to a statement issued here. In the medium-term, Pakistan�s growth is expected to continue to accelerate, reaching 5 percent in FY17.�Pakistan continues to make good progress in restoring macroeconomic stability. Building on this Pakistan needs to push forward with deeper structural reforms that spread benefits more widely, and the World Bank stands ready to support the reforms agenda,� says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.Pakistan�s growth was driven by domestic consumption that continues to compensate for weak global demand. The report warned that Pakistan�s low rates of investment and declining export competitiveness, however, remain a concern.The report said that growth acceleration will depend on the implementation of structural reforms, such as energy and taxation and implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).In the long term, growth will be driven by increased investment in both physical and human capital, with increased focus on better nutrition, health and education outcomes.�Pakistan has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last decade. Based on the revised poverty line adopted in early 2016, the percentage of people living below the poverty line decreased from 64.3 percent in FY02 to 29.5 percent in FY14,� the report said. �This reduction in poverty is corroborated when analyzing other data, such as asset ownership�, says Muhammad Waheed, Senior Economist and lead author of the report.Projected even higher growth in FY18, the report also expects a moderate increase in investment (related to CPEC projects) will to contribute to an acceleration of growth, which will continue to be driven by public and private consumption.Pakistan�s growth in FY16 was driven by strong domestic demand.Consumption accounted for an overwhelming 92 percent of GDP in FY16, and contributed 7 percentage points towards GDP growth, supported by sustained growth in remittances.Strong aggregate demand and improving business sentiments were evident in private sector credit growth of 12 percent, expanding by Rs. 461 billion in FY16 compared with Rs. 224 billion in FY15, the report said. Low inflation and low interest rates also contributed to higher credit growth.�The government�s efforts to stabilize the macroeconomic environment provided a better footing for economic activity, while marginal improvements in energy supplies facilitated manufacturing growth in particular,� the report added.The World Bank�s 2017 Doing Business report found that Pakistan improved four ranks in 2017, placing it among the top ten �most improved� countries. Revenue growth is underpinning the falling deficit, driven in FY16 by a 20 percent increase in the Federal Board of Revenue�s (FBR) collection.A series of new tax measures in the FY17 budget will broaden the tax base and are expected to contribute to another significant increase in FBR revenues. On the expenditure side, the development budget has grown faster than the recurrent budget.In the FY17 budget, an expected reduction in state-owned enterprise subsidies and interest payments has created space for an increase in infrastructure spending, including on CPEC projects.��",11/11/2016,,

The IEA suggested prices may continue to retreat amid relentless supply growth unless OPEC makes significant supply cuts,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.The supply overhang could run into a third year in 2017 without an output cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), while escalating production from other exporters could lead to relentless supply growth, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.In its monthly oil market report, the group said global supply rose by 800,000 barrels per day in October to 97.8 million bpd, led by record OPEC output and rising production from non-OPEC members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.The IEA kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2 million bpd and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015.Beyond oversupply, a surging dollar following the initial shock of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win also put pressure on prices, traders said.Because oil and refined products are traded in dollars, its import costs rise for any country using other currencies at home, potentially crimping demand.",11/11/2016,,

""It encourages non-executive directors inclusion in the board and provisions for the manner of selection and maintenance of data bank of independent directors,"" the ministers said in a statement.It also aims at addressing the issues relating to protection of interest of minority shareholders and creditors.The new ordinance also introduces other reforms such as relaxations for free zone companies�, registration of agricultural promotion companies for the development of agricultural sector and the establishment of Investor Education and Awareness Fund, the finance minister added.It also includes provisions for the registration of valuers dispute resolution mechanism through mediation and conciliation panel, passing of members resolution through circulation and simplified provisions for expeditious mergers and acquisitions.In addition, Dar said the Companies Ordinance 2016 emphasises maximum disclosures by Pakistanis to the local regulatory authorities in respect of investment in foreign companies.It also provides facilitation and regulation of the public sector enterprises.Under the new ordinance, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will maintain Companies Global Register of Beneficial Ownership, which will have complete record of the beneficial ownership of the substantial shareholders and officers in local and foreign companies doing business in Pakistan, he added.Moreover, he said, it will be binding on the foreign company operating in Pakistan to provide complete information of its directors, officers and or beneficial owners.Dar said that to ensure adequate measures against fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, the new ordinance empowers the SECP to investigate and also conduct joint investigations.Further, provisions requiring officers of a company to take adequate measures to curb such violations have also been included.The minister said the Companies Ordinance 2016 has been promulgated to provide relief and incentives to the corporate sector, especially small- and medium-sized companies and to give immediate impetus to the economy and stimulate economic growth.There was a need to revamp the 32 years old Companies Ordinance 1984 to provide an improved competitive legal framework for the corporate sector in Pakistan.The finance minister said during various stakeholder consultations, market experts and the business community had expressed unanimous support for enacting Companies Ordinance 2016 at the earliest, as it would help address the longstanding demands of the business community.The new ordinance will reduce the cost of incorporating and doing business, which will enable Pakistan's corporate sector to remain competitive in the international markets, he added.The finance minister appreciated the efforts of the SECP, Finance Ministry and various other stakeholders who made recommendations, leading to the finalisation and promulgation of the Companies Ordinance 2016.�",11/13/2016,,
business,Cash bet could make break Modi,"strong>HONG KONG: Narendra Modi's banknote recall is becoming a make-or-break moment. India's prime minister is under fire after a move to cancel large-denomination rupee notes amounting to 86 percent of the total outstanding by value. The bold step to fight corruption has left Indians queuing outside bank branches since Wednesday to swap old notes for legal tender, bringing parts of the nation's economy to a standstill.</strongThe pain is most palpable for the informal sector, which accounts for almost half of GDP and the vast majority of employment. Tendering old notes above a minimal value for new ones requires a bank account, but 40 percent of the population is outside of the formal banking system. No wonder tensions are running high.If Modi can ride out the immediate backlash, though, demonetisation could potentially provide a big fiscal boost. Suppose that holders of one-fifth of the notes in circulation will not try to exchange them out of fear of attracting scrutiny from tax authorities. That means currency worth almost $50 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, could suddenly become worthless.In theory that would sharply reduce the monetary liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India, and brokerage Edelweiss reckons that in turn could allow the central bank to pay a higher dividend to the government. Other economists suggest this may not be legally possible, but the RBI does face pressure each year to boost its payouts to New Delhi.A windfall could help India boost spending while meeting its ambitious plan to narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by March 2018. It would give Modi the funds for big-ticket items such as a recapitalization of the nation's ailing state-backed lenders, which could require more than $30 billion.The twin effects of a slowdown in economic activity and the reduction in money supply should also bring down inflation, making room for more interest rate cuts, which could boost growth in the medium term.The recall is certainly working: Banks have already collected a staggering $44 billion of deposits in barely five days. Modi clearly hopes that it will do the economy more good than harm once the initial shock of last week's move wears off. Either way, it could prove central to his legacy.",11/14/2016,,

business,Oil wars how Kremlin 13 billion Indian deal fell apar,"strong>LONDON/NEW DELHI/MOSCOW: A multi-billion-dollar Russian deal to buy Indian refiner Essar was nearly sunk at the eleventh hour by a rival bid from Saudi Arabia as the two oil superpowers vie for supremacy across the world.</strongThe deal between Essar and a consortium led by Kremlin oil giant Rosneft appeared dead in the water two months ago after Saudi state energy firm Aramco weighed in, according to seven Russia, India and Saudi-based industry sources familiar with or involved in the negotiations.It was salvaged due to the involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who were keen for it go through, and after the consortium agreed to pay $13 billion - more than double what Rosneft had initially valued Essar at, sources told Reuters.This made the refiner the biggest-ever foreign acquisition in India and Russia's largest outbound deal.The tussle for Essar - a state-of-the-art plant in the world's fastest-growing fuel market - illustrates the growing battle for oil markets between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest crude exporters.It also sheds light on the challenges OPEC member Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia - which are also fighting a proxy conflict in Syria's civil war - will face in trying to clinch a global agreement to limit output growth to prop up oil prices.The full details of how the Essar deal was struck remain unclear. Two industry sources said it was rescued thanks to the involvement of Putin and Modi while three other sources said Rosneft had simply outbid Saudi Aramco.Officials in Modi's office declined to comment while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was any Kremlin intervention in the deal.""Naturally, we defend the interests of our companies. Of course we lobby for them, especially on such large deals,"" said Peskov, but added that in the case of Essar ""there were no orders from the Kremlin"".""It was a corporate decision by Rosneft to gain synergies via cooperation with India,"" he said.Rosneft and Saudi Aramco declined to comment.Essar said it had held discussions with several potential buyers but had gone with the Rosneft consortium because their offer was considered the most attractive. It denied there was any intervention from Putin or Modi.strong>SHOWDOWN</strongRosneft boss Igor Sechin is keen to buy refining assets around the world to guarantee outlets for Russian oil. He had been negotiating since 2014 to buy 49 percent of Essar from its owners, Indian brothers Ravi and Shashi Ruia, and the two parties had been in exclusive talks since July 2015 when a preliminary deal was signed.While the exact amount Rosneft was prepared to offer for the stake at that stage is unclear, Russian and Indian industry sources said it valued the whole of Essar at about $5.7 billion.However it became apparent that there were problems with the deal in early September, when Sechin travelled to India to meet the Ruia brothers, flying from Hangzhou, China, where he had been part of Putin's G20 summit delegation.Sechin walked into the meeting with the Ruia brothers soon after landing in India at 1 a.m., determined to close the deal, according to sources briefed on the discussions.As the meeting started, one of the brothers told Sechin the deal process had been going on for too long, the exclusivity period had expired in July and Essar was now talking to other parties.Those other parties included Saudi Aramco, he said.According to the sources familiar with how the meeting unfolded, Sechin responded by saying that if Essar walked away from the deal it risked losing Russian financial and oil-supply support.The Ruia brothers then said the talks with Rosneft were over and called an abrupt end to the meeting.""People started leaving the room, embarrassed,"" one of the sources said. Another source said the Essar management had drafted a statement to say the deal with Rosneft was off.Rosneft and Essar declined to comment on what transpired at the meeting, or on whether such a statement had existed. Sechin and the Ruia brothers could not be reached for comment.Three Saudi-based sources familiar with details of talks between Essar and Saudi Aramco said the firm was seriously considering buying Essar. One of the sources said Aramco was prepared to pay up to $9 billion for all or most of the refiner.Aramco declined to comment on whether it had made a bid.strong>TOO BIG TO FAIL</strongIn the end, however, the Rosneft-Essar deal proved to be too big to fail.For India, a deal collapse or a delay because of talks with another party would set back Modi's drive to clean up India's $140 billion mountain of bad debt given Essar's multi-billion-dollar debts to local and foreign banks after years of rapid expansion.For Russia, the deal in the huge Indian market represented an important milestone in building a global oil empire despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.Facing the Saudi competition, Rosneft formed a consortium that bought 98 per cent of the refiner plus a fuel terminal for $13 billion. The Kremlin oil firm bought 49 percent - below the 50 percent level that would have fallen foul of Western sanctions - with Swiss trading house Trafigura and Russian private investment group UCP buying the other 49 percent.According to the Indian and Russian industry sources, Rosneft and Essar returned to the negotiating table within days of the spat in early September, and the deal was finally struck.One of the sources said there was a fierce battle between Essar and Rosneft over the terms. They said the Russian-led consortium was forced to outbid the Saudi offer, which they said comprised a combination of cash, long-term low interest credit and oil supplies.Trafigura declined to comment on how the deal came together, while UCP did not reply to a written request asking for comment. Washington said the deal did not violate sanctions.The deal was signed in Mauritius on Oct. 14, a day before a formal announcement on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Goa where Putin and Modi met. The leaders also oversaw the signing of a raft of other transactions including India agreeing to pay $5 billion for Russian long-range air defence missile systems.Two industry sources said the Essar deal had first been discussed by Putin and Modi as far back as May 2014 on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia's main investor show.It was unclear what form - if any - high-level government intervention might have taken after the September dispute.But the two sources said that without political will in Moscow and New Delhi, an agreement could not have been struck.""Putin and Modi saved that deal,"" said one.",11/16/2016,,

If you look at the U.S. markets, investors are looking at coming infrastructure spending and so on and they are rotating to stocks from bonds,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped to 2.230 percent from Monday's 11-month high of 2.302 percent, although that is sharply above its levels around 1.86 percent before the election.U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in an 85 percent chance of a rate hike, compared to 75 percent before the election.Nikko SMBC Securities estimates U.S. two-year notes are currently pricing in five Fed rate hikes in the next two years, said senior strategist Makoto Noji.""If we base our assumption on (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen's gradualist approach, which can be roughly translated as two rate hikes per year, we could say that the market has already priced in tightening they could reasonably imagine at this point,"" he said.""But of course if Trump's policies stoke inflation that cannot be contained by two rate hikes per year, the U.S. bond market could see big moves again,"" he added.Sharp gains in U.S. bond yields are seen as boosting the attraction of dollars.The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies hit its highest level in almost a year.It stood at 100.16, standing just 0.3 percent below its 13-year peak hit in December last year.The euro traded at $1.0724, just above Monday's $1.0709, its lowest level in almost a year.The U.S. currency fetched 109.03 yen, having hit 5 1/2-month high of 109.34 yen.Gold traded at $1,228.6 per ounce, not far from a 5 1/2-month low of $1,211.8 seen on Monday.The dollar's strength has fanned fears investors could shift their funds to the U.S. from emerging markets. Emerging market stocks managed to rise 0.3 percent on Tuesday after having fallen 7 percent over the previous four sessions.In contrast, oil prices hovered near their highest levels in about two weeks after having jumped nearly 6 percent on Tuesday on bets OPEC members will agree to cut output when they meet later this month.U.S. crude futures stood at $45.67 per barrel, after having risen to $46.09 late on Tuesday, their highest since Nov 2.",11/16/2016,,

business,Iran overtakes Saudi Arabia top oil supplier Indi,"strong>NEW DELHI: Iran overtook political rival Saudi Arabia as India's top oil supplier in October, shipping data showed, just ahead of a producers' meeting this month to hammer out the details on output cuts aimed at reining in a global glut.</strongIran used to be India's second-biggest oil supplier, a position it ceded to Iraq after tough Western sanctions over its nuclear development programme limited Tehran's exports and access to finance.But India's oil imports from Iran have shot up this year after those sanctions were lifted in January. In October they surged more than threefold compared with the same month last year, rising to 789,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to ship tracking data and a report compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.That compares to 697,000 bpd supplied last month by Saudi Arabia. Over the whole January to October period, though, Saudi Arabia still holds India's top supply spot, at an average of 830,000 bpd versus Iraq's 784,000 bpd and Iran's 456,400 bpd.Iran's surge to the No.1 spot is due partly to less available crude from Saudi Arabia, which has increased its capacity to refine oil instead of just exporting more crude.""Saudi Arabia's refining capacity has increased over time so it is not in a position to increase its exports further, whereas Iran is better placed to raise its output and sales to India,"" said Ehsaan Ul Haq of U.K.-based consultancy KBC Energy.The surge is also thanks to Iranian price discounts, which attracted purchases from India's programme to build up its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR). Last month India took in 2 million barrels of Iranian crude for the SPR stocks, and another 4 million barrels is expected to be shipped in November.In the first seven months of its fiscal year, between April and October, India imported 523,200 bpd from Iran, compared to 249,100 bpd for the same period a year ago.strong>RETURNING BUYERS</strongIndian refiners including Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refinery complex at Jamnagar, that had stopped imports from Iran during the sanctions period have also returned as buyers of Iranian oil.Iran produces almost 4 million bpd of oil and exports 2.4 million bpd. Tehran's exports dropped to 1 million bpd during sanctions, down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in 2011, before tougher Western sanctions were implemented.Gaining the top position as oil supplier to the world's third-biggest importer, even if only for one month, comes at a sensitive time.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet on Nov. 30 to finalise a planned production cut aimed at propping up prices, which continue to languish below $50 per barrel due to oversupply.Exemptions to the planned cuts were given to Libya and Nigeria, where output has suffered from conflict, and sanctions-hit Iran. Given Iran has now pipped de-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia in India, those exemptions might be more difficult to defend during the upcoming meeting.",11/17/2016,,
business,Stalled luxury hotel apartment projects Afghan capital lost 85 milli,"strong>KABUL: Stalled luxury hotel and apartment projects next to the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital may have lost American taxpayers $85 million and left the partially constructed buildings as security threats, a government watchdog said on Thursday.</strongThe projects were partially funded by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a U.S. government agency that aims to help foreign investment.But both now appear to have been abandoned in a climate of increasing concern over security, according to a letter to OPIC from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.A suicide bomb attack on Wednesday killed four people in Kabul, illustrating the precarious security involving not only Islamic State and a Taliban insurgency but also a wider breakdown in law and order as government control has weakened.""The $85 million in loans is gone, the buildings were never completed and are uninhabitable, and the U.S. Embassy is now forced to provide security for the site at additional cost to U.S. taxpayers,"" the letter said, accusing the developer of possible fraud and OPIC of lax oversight.Ground was first broken for the hotel in 2004 by then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai, with the project financed in part by an OPIC loan of $40 million that U.S. officials at the time called the ""largest U.S. private investment in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban"" in 2001.It was initially to be run by Hyatt International Corporation and finished in 18 months, according to news reports at the time, but that never happened.By 2007, a group of companies received a new loan of $60 million to complete the hotel and Marriott International had agreed to manage it, the letter said. It is not clear what happened to the initial $40 million in loans.strong>""FALSE ASSURANCES""</strongIn 2013, construction was dragging on, but the developer, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, promised it would be complete by the end of the year and OPIC approved the disbursement of the last funding, SIGAR reported in the letter.Marriott reportedly withdrew from the hotel and right after receiving the final loan funding, the developer told OPIC it was stopping all work on the project, SIGAR said.""Based on our inspections it is clear that the assurances made to obtain the final loan disbursement were false and misleading,"" investigators said. ""We are currently determining whether earlier representations made to justify the prior disbursements were also false and misleading.""To this day the hulking building sits empty, overlooking the U.S. Embassy which pays an untold amount of money to secure the structure, according to SIGAR.The same developer was also involved in a related project to build a neighbouring apartment complex with $27 million in OPIC loans, but construction there was also halted after the company received the last funding, SIGAR reported.""As with the hotel, we found that the apartment project was never finished and appears to be abandoned, and that representations made to OPIC that the building could open by August 2013 were blatantly false and unrealistic.""In a response to SIGAR, released along with the letter, OPIC said it was aware of ""issues"" with the building, but that at the time it believed the developer was making ""good faith efforts"" to complete the project.""As a lender, OPIC does not control the project, but has encouraged the project developer to find a third party to either purchase the project or provide additional funds to complete it,"" the agency said in its response.",11/18/2016,,

business,Xi pushes China backed trade deals to fill US void,"Lima, Nov 19, 2016 (AFP) -Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Asia-Pacific leaders Saturday to get on board with Beijing-backed free trade agreements, after Donald Trump�s election win spelled the likely demise of a US-backed deal.Trump�s shock victory has cast uncertainty on the future of Washington�s key trade initiative in the Pacific Rim, the arduously negotiated, 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.The brash billionaire campaigned against the accord, which has not yet been ratified in Congress, as a ""terrible deal"" that would ""rape"" the United States by sending American jobs to countries with cheaper labor.In a Pacific region hungry for trade, that has left even longtime US allies like Australia and Japan looking to China to fill the void.Beijing, which was excluded from TPP, is pushing two alternatives: the 21-member Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and a 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which notably includes India but not the United States.Xi urged regional leaders to advance both deals at a summit in Lima, Peru, where the uncertainty unleashed on the world stage by Trump�s victory loomed large.""Building a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for the long-term prosperity of the Asia-Pacific,"" Xi said in a keynote address to business leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group.""We should firmly pursue FTAAP,"" he said. ""Openness is vital for the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific.""In the face of Trump�s protectionist rhetoric, he vowed China ""will not shut its door to the outside world, but open it even wider.""""We will fully involve ourselves in economic globalization by supporting the multi-lateral trading regime, advancing the FTAAP and working for the early conclusion of the negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,"" he said.China describes RCEP as a stepping stone toward FTAAP, a vast plan that would include all 21 APEC members and is expected to take years, if it happens at all.The meeting of APEC, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world�s population and nearly 60 percent of the global economy, is US President Barack Obama�s last foreign visit before handing over to Trump on January 20.Obama and Xi, the leaders of the world�s top two economies, were due to hold their last meeting later Saturday.",11/19/2016,,
business,Rs 1492 bln transacted through Mobile Banking one year,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has witnessed an amount of Rs. 1,492 billion which was transacted through Mobile Banking during 2015-16.</strongThis is testimony of the fact that transaction through mobile money has potential to expand reach of banking services to 85 per cent unbanked population of Pakistan.During October to December, 2015 the total volume of branchless banking was over Rs.486 billion while the number of branchless banking transactions surpassed Rs. 101.6 billion during same period.The amalgamation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and banking services can help in moving towards a fully documented economy which is necessary to improve the tax collection circle and achievement of 18 per cent tax to GDP ratio as stated under the goals of the Pakistan Vision 2025.As per data in Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA)�s annual report, the telecom sector has contributed Rs. 157.8 billion during fiscal year 2015-16 to national kitty as compared to Rs. 126.3 billion registered during previous year.The comparison of growth between telecom revenue and telecom contribution over last fiscal year showed that the government collections have actually increased by 25 per cent whereas telecom revenues witnessed only 1.47% have raise during 2015-16.The unprecedented collection during 2013-14 was mainly due to extraordinary deposits as a result of 3G and 4G spectrum auction.In reported period telecom sector continued to grow positively in terms of subscription, revenues and tele-density.Broadband penetration has increased to 18.3 per cent from just 2 per cent in year 2014.The ICT solutions, being offered on mobile broadband, are making a big difference in every walk of life.Hundreds of billions of rupees are being sent and received over the mobile money channels by people of Pakistan.The innovative and cost-effective solutions are also being offered in e-commerce, online education, e-health, travel and governance sectors.Due to such high demand for mobile broadband services, Telenor Pakistan acquired 4G spectrum for US $ 395 million during 2015-16.Furthermore, the government collections will also increase from other sectors of economy due to broadband and ICT proliferation.It may be further added that one component of overall government collections i.e. GST was decreased but there could be a number of factors behind this decline.For example, the Federal government and the Government of Punjab have exempted GST on internet/data services whereas the Government of Sindh is charging reduced rate on internet/data services.Resultantly, the share of tax-exempted data revenue in total telecom revenues increased to 29 per cent in 2015-16 as compared to 19.3 per cent in 2013-14.However, the trade-off between GST collection and internet/broadband development turned out to be a wise decision by the Federal, Punjab and Sindh governments.",11/19/2016,,
business,Asian shares on the defensive as US yields dollar ri,"strong>TOKYO: Asian shares were on the defensive on Monday, undermined by fears that the strength in the U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond yields since Donald Trump's election to president could accelerate fund outflows from emerging markets.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent, staying near four-month lows. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3 percent as the yen continued to slip against the dollar.Trump's unexpected election victory has led to a major repricing of assets, with investors rushing to buy U.S. stocks and the dollar, while dumping bonds and emerging market assets.Carrying out even some of his plans for deregulation and tax cuts would undermine assumptions investors had long held - that the U.S. economy would grow modestly and inflation would remain tame in the foreseeable future.Trump's protectionism could hurt many of U.S. trade partners, including emerging markets which could see decline in exports to the U.S..To be sure, investors have little idea to what extent Trump can implement his proposals, including slapping tariffs on major trading partners such as China and Mexico and heavy tax cuts that would widen the U.S. fiscal deficit.Some investors think the market will have reality check as soon as differences between the new administration and Congress appear over some of Trump's policies.""Next week, we have events that would make investors more sober, such as OPEC meeting and Italian referendum. By then this Trump-inspired market may come to an end for now,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Yet heightened uncertainty prompted investors to demand a larger premium for holding long-term U.S. debt, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield soaring to 2.364 percent by last week from around 1.86 percent before the elections.It last stood at 2.353 percent, with a rise above its 2015 peak of 2.5 percent seen as having potential to spark a further sell-off as bond prices fall.Higher U.S. yields are helping the dollar continue its bull run. The U.S. unit rose to as high as 111.125, its highest level since early June. It last stood at 110.865.It has risen almost 10 percent from its low of 101.19 hit on Nov 9, when markets initially took Trump's victory will trigger a rush to safer assets such as the yen.The euro traded $1.0589, having hit a near one-year low of $1.0569 on Friday.The Australian dollar hit 4 1/2-month low of $0.7315.The data from the U.S. financial watchdog showed on Friday that in the first week after the U.S. elections speculators hardly increased their net long positions in the dollar.""This suggests the leveraged fund community largely missed out on the dollar rally,"" analysts at ANZ Research wrote.Oil prices rose in early Monday trade after five-percent gains last week, their first weekly gains in about a month, on growing expectations that OPEC will find a way to cap production.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is moving closer to finalising its first deal since 2008 to limit output, with most members prepared to offer Iran flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said.Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 1.1 percent to $47.35 per barrel.",11/21/2016,,

The culprits were not only tax dodgers, Stiglitz and Pieth said, but money launderers for a wide variety of criminal groups including a Russian child pornography ring.The official report calls for ""anti-corruption legislation that addresses acts performed by Panamanian nationals or economic groups established in Panama that directly or indirectly participate in the implementation of illegal activities in third countries.""",11/22/2016,,

Reuters commodities analyst Wang Tao said that Brent could rise to $49.85 per barrel, a level marked by several technical resistance factors.Despite Wednesday's slight increases, analysts said that the market was currently unwilling to push crude prices to $50 a barrel or higher.""The market seems unwilling to push oil towards $50 a barrel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA brokerage in Singapore. ""Their reticence is understandable given that longs (long positions) put on above that level have not ended well in recent times.""""Tonight's (U.S.) EIA Crude Inventory numbers should provide a welcome, albeit temporary sideshow to the OPEC main event. Otherwise, we expect Asia to continue the sideways trading ranges,"" Halley said.The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due to publish official U.S. crude oil and refined product inventory data later on Wednesday.Wednesday's lethargy came after oil prices rallied earlier this week. Traders anticipated the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would successfully implement a planned, coordinated production cut - to be discussed at a Nov. 30 meeting - in order to prop up prices.However, by late Tuesday analysts had become wary of the prospects for such a deal, as it remained unclear whether major OPEC-producers Iraq and Iran were willing to participate in a meaningful way.""Cracks in the OPEC production cut agreement could see oil prices weaker in trading today,"" ANZ bank said in a note on Wednesday.""A preliminary meeting ahead of next week's OPEC gathering failed to resolve the issues around Iran and Iraq's involvement in the production cut agreement,"" it said.

business,New LNG buyer Pakistan sees strong interest in giant tender,"strong>TOKYO: Pakistan LNG Ltd has received strong interest in its tender to buy as many as 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from suppliers hungry to sell gas in an oversupplied market, a senior official told Reuters on Thursday.</strongThe emergence of Pakistan as a large-scale buyer is a welcome boost in the market for the supercooled gas as demand slows in traditional big buyers like Japan. Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of 2014 as new supplies have flooded the market.Launched earlier this month, the tender for a combination of mid- and long-term shipments ""has been extremely well received,"" said Adnan Gilani, chief operating officer of state-owned Pakistan LNG.""The response is beyond what we thought,"" the executive said, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Tokyo. Gilani didn't identify any of the bidding suppliers.The company launched its tender to purchase a combined 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG),The mid-term tender covers a period of five years and calls for 60 shipments, while the long-term tender is for 15 years and 180 cargoes, according to information presented in the tender documents released on the company's website earlier this month.More than 20 global oil and gas majors and traders attended a bidders conference held by Pakistan LNG two days ago, Gilani said, adding as many as 10 more expressed interest without attending. The deadline for bidding is Dec. 20, he said.Pakistan LNG will launch a new tender for 4.5 million tonnes of LNG ""within a few months"", and six months later it will seek bids for another 4.5 million tonnes, he said.By 2019 Pakistan, which can only meet two-thirds of its gas demand, expects to be importing about 23 million tonnes of LNG a year via five terminals to fuel power stations and vehicles.""We are buying for our baseload needs,"" he said.

Shahzad Sky for Rs 4.90 billion and M/s. Star time for Rs 4.89 billion respectively.�A total of 11 companies � Orient Electronics Lahore, Mag Entertainment Lahore, Skyflix Islamabad, Smartimes Communications Islamabad, Sardar Builders Islamabad, Smart Sky Islamabad, Parus Media and Broadcast Islamabad, NayaTel Islamabad, Shahzad Sky, Islamabad, HB DTH Islamabad and IQ Communications Karachi � took part in the bidding process to secure the three licences.�All the three licences were sold for Rs 14.69 billion,� informed Chairman PEMRA Absar Alam, while speaking to the press.PEMRA Chairman congratulated the winning companies and said the initiative was going to be a game-changer for Pakistan�s electronic media industry.�To date, this is the biggest investment in Pakistan�s electronic media history,� he said and added as per the estimates and feasibility studies carried out by PEMRA experts, the overall investment would be $450 million ($150 million each) and could touch $750 million more in the next two years. These estimates did not include the bidding proceeds, he made it clear.The DTH service, he said, was a state-of-the art technology offering new dimensions of distribution system and a wide range of choice to consumers. �The current analogue distribution system is offering a maximum of 80 channels while the DTH would increase the capacity to around 120 and each local DTH licence holder is expected to have at least 500,000 subscribers,� said Absar Alam.Besides lucrative investment, the DTH regime would also make a significant contribution to job generation in the country leading to 15,000 jobs (5,000 by each company) i.e. new direct employment opportunities, he maintained.Absar Alam said the DTH service would not end the cable operators� business, but would compel them to invest in technology and their distribution systems.However, the media watchdog issued non-exclusive licences for 15 years to the successful bidders after the open outcry bidding.Pakistani DTH services, once launched, will counter the sale of illegal Indian DTH services in Pakistan, which incur a heavy loss to the national exchequer because of transfer of between $200 million to $350 million to India annually on account of subscription fee. Now the legal DTH services will give consumers a choice against the current monopoly of cable operators as well.Pakistan has nearly 25 million electronic media subscribers and between three to five million consumers use Indian DTH illegally. After issuance of licences, subscribers of Indian DTH would have to shift to the local network.Similarly, foreign channels will get landing rights to come under the local regime through a regulatory process and launching of new local satellite channels will be allowed.The DTH licence holders will have to start operations within the year or risk termination of licences. The bidders are required to deposit 15 percent of the bid money at the outset of the bidding as earnest money, followed by 50 percent of the bid money upfront. The remaining amount could be paid immediately or in three yearly instalments at a mark-up rate.Each DTH licence holder is required to pay an annual fee of Rs10 million and contribute two percent of their gross revenue after the first three years of operations.Licenses to the bid winners would be awarded after clearance from the interior ministry and law enforcement agencies.",11/24/2016,,
business,China to make extra 85 bn investments in Pakistan rail energy,"strong>LONDON: Pakistan has secured an additional $8.5 billion of investment from Beijing as part of the countries' joint energy, transport and infrastructure plan, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Wednesday.</strongThat is on top of the $46-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, which focuses on road building and energy infrastructure to end chronic power shortages in Pakistan and to link China's landlocked north-west with the deep-water port Gwadar on the Arabian Sea.Some $4.5 billion of the additional investment will be spent on upgrading tracks and signaling on Pakistan's main railway line from Karachi to Peshawar and increase the speed on the line to 160 km per hour from the current 60-80 kph, Iqbal told Reuters in an interview.Another $4 billion will go toward an LNG terminal and transmission line, he added.""This has now all been approved, so this is an additional $8.5 billion to the $46 billion we had already, so we are now close to $55 billion,"" Iqbal said.The International Monetary Fund said in June that repayments and profit repatriation from large-scale investments such as CPEC could add to Pakistan's medium- and long-term risks, predicting that the country's gross external financing needs would rise to $15.1 billion in 2018/2019 from $11.4 billion in the current financial year.But Iqbal said those risks would be countered by the economic boost the investment would give to industries such as steel, construction and engineering, pushing future annual growth to above 6 percent.In July the IMF upped its forecast for growth in Pakistan to 5 percent from 4.7 percent in the fiscal year to June 2017, citing China's investment plans.""As the economy grows, our capacity to undertake the responsibilities of repayments also improves, what really matters is that all of that investment is going into productive sectors,"" Iqbal said.Under CPEC, a number of new economic zones will be created along the corridor. Pakistan hopes that some industry will relocate from China, due to cheaper wages and production costs, Iqbal said.""Our preferred mode is joint ventures, because that will give a stake to both Pakistani and Chinese enterprises so now our government is actively promoting business-to-business links,"" he said.",11/24/2016,,

For the week, the Dow and Nasdaq gained 1.5 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.4 percent.The S&amp;P 500 consumer staples index's 0.8 percent gain boosted shares on Black Friday, which traditionally kicks off the U.S. holiday shopping season.European stocks notched a third straight week of gains, even as a tumble in oil prices dragged commodities shares lower. Uncertainty over whether OPEC will agree to cut production at the group's meeting next week weighed on crude prices.Expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, higher infrastructure spending and reduced regulation would benefit certain industries, including banking, industrials and healthcare, have underpinned multiple recent all-time highs in U.S. shares.""While many stocks have risen quite briskly, investors are looking for some forgotten names in the rally,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 1.86 points, or 0.45 percent, at 414.99.The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 68.96 points, or 0.36 percent, at 19,152.14.

business,OPEC scrambles agree crucial oil output cu,"strong>VIENNA: OPEC members will seek to give oil prices a boost in Vienna on Wednesday by nailing down their first output cut in eight years, although a deal is far from certain.</strongFailure to get an accord could send oil prices tumbling and reignite debate about the purpose of the 56-year-old Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Not getting a deal ""could be the end of OPEC"", energy analyst Alexandre Andlauer told AFP. Pessimism about prospects for an agreement sent oil prices lower on Friday.In September the cartel agreed in principle to lower production to 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), meaning a cut of between 600,000 and 1.1 million bpd.This, OPEC�s 14 members hope, will reduce the mammoth global supply glut and so increase the market price of oil from its current painful level of below $50 a barrel.It also marks a reversal of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia�s two-year-old strategy of flooding the market to squeeze out rivals, in particular US shale oil producers.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who was due in Vienna for the talks with other OPEC ministers, said this month an agreement was ""imperative"".strong>- Devil in the detail -</strongBut it remains to be agreed what size cuts, if any, each of OPEC�s members will make, particularly Iraq and Iran, the cartel�s next-biggest producers after Riyadh.Strife-torn Libya on Sunday ruled itself out of any cuts, arguing that it was in ""such a dangerous economic situation"" that there was no way it could take part.Iraq has said it will cut output but that it is short of money needed to fight Islamic State extremists. It also disputes with OPEC the level of its current output.Iran, newly free of export restrictions since last year�s nuclear deal, says it won�t cut production until it has reached pre-sanctions levels.Adding to the difficulties is the fierce rivalry between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, engaged in a proxy war in Yemen and backing different sides in Syria.strong>- Russia on board? -</strongAs the meeting has approached, OPEC members turned their sights on non-cartel producers, particularly Russia, for a pledge they would also tighten the taps.Securing a commitment from non-OPEC nations is important because the cartel only produces about a third of the world�s oil, meaning its ability to influence prices is limited.Algeria�s oil minister said in Iran this weekend that OPEC is prepared to cut production by 1.1 million bpd if non-members reduce by 600,000 bpd, local media reported.President Vladimir Putin said last week Russia was ready to ""freeze production"", but stopped short of promising a cut.Russia, its finances hit by low oil prices and Western sanctions, is pumping some 11 million bpd, more even than Saudi Arabia and at levels not seen since Soviet days.In a sign of ongoing tensions, Saudi Arabia pulled out of talks due Monday with non-OPEC producers including Russia ahead of the Vienna meeting, Bloomberg News reported.The news agency said Sunday that Algeria and Venezuela�s oil ministers would travel to Moscow on Monday to try to get Russia on board.strong>- Prices at the pump -</strongIf OPEC does manage to get a deal and oil prices rise -- though the increase may be modest -- then this will hit the wallets of billions of consumers worldwide.But higher oil prices might actually help the global economy, according to research by Goldman Sachs published by Bloomberg.This is because richer oil producers would then pump more liquidity into the global financial system.Low oil prices have blown a massive hole in producers� finances in recent years, hurting not just more vulnerable OPEC members like Venezuela and Nigeria but even the Gulf states.Saudi Arabia, once seen as fabulously wealthy, is projecting a budget deficit of $87 billion in 2016. It has slashed spending and salaries and owes private firms billions of dollars.Two years of low prices have also hit investment in oil facilities, raising the prospect of supply problems in the medium term, experts say.",11/28/2016,,

business,Paris restaurant best in world but Japanese chefs come out ,"PARIS: A Paris restaurant run by chef Guy Savoy was named the best in the world Wednesday -- according to the French-based guides aggregator La Liste -- but Japanese restaurants came out on top overall.Double Emmy-award-winning US television chef Eric Ripert came joint second for his New York fish restaurant Le Bernardin, sharing the honour with the minuscule Tokyo restaurant, Kyo Aji.Kyo Aji helped ensure that Japan triumphed again in the country rankings, with 116 of the top-rated 1,000 restaurants, three more than France, with Chinese chefs coming third. But restaurants in Italy came out best on value for money.Savoy�s restaurant in la Monnaie, the old French national mint on the Left Bank of the River Seine, is famous for its artichoke soup with black truffle and filo pastry mushroom brioche and ""cold steamed"" blue lobster. His 18-course ""Innovations and Inspirations"" menu costs 490 euros ($520) without wine.It was the top-rated French restaurant last year coming in fourth place in the La Liste, which was set up as a ""more scientific and reliable"" rival to the British-based 50 Best Restaurants ranking.Savoy -- who trained the volcanic British chef Gordon Ramsay and remains his mentor -- controversially did not make the 50 Best this year. Nor did Kenichiro Nishi of Kyo Aji, whom La Liste called ""the undisputed master of kaiseki"", the traditional multi-course Japanese dinner.French-born Ripert, 51, a Buddhist who picked up his Emmys for his PBS show ""Avec Eric"", already holds the maximum three Michelin stars.La Liste bills itself as a ""guide of the guides"", pulling together reviews from almost 400 guide books, newspapers and online sites from TripAdvisor to the New York Times and the prestigious Michelin rankings. But tragedy struck the first winner Franco-Swiss chef Benoit Violier, who killed himself a month after winning for the Hotel de Ville at Crissier near Lausanne in Switzerland.Savoy, 63, a three-Michelin-starred chef, comes from humble origins. His father was a municipal gardener in the small town of Bourgoin-Jailleu near Lyon in eastern France where his mother ran a fast-food ""buvette"".He later trained as a chocolate maker before being taken on as an apprentice by the legendary Troisgros brothers for their restaurant in nearby Roanne.La Liste�s founder Philippe Faure, the head of the French tourist board, has accused the 50 Best of consistently ""denigrating"" French restaurants in its listing.While 50 Best has repeatedly denied the charge, no French restaurants have made its top 10 for the last few years.Faure said his listing was compiled impartially from a rigorous mathematical analysis of hundreds of guides and thousands of reviews.La Liste has now also launched a smartphone application in six languages aimed at international travellers for its 1,000 top-rated restaurants in the world, plus the 10,000 eateries which its analysis found to be the best value.�",11/30/2016,,

West Texas Intermediate was up $3.98 at $49.21.The accord announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is aimed at reducing a global supply glut that has kept prices painfully low.It represents a dramatic reversal from OPEC�s Saudi-led strategy, introduced in 2014, of flooding the market to pressure rivals, in particular US shale oil producers.The cartel will lower its monthly output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 32.5 million bpd from January 1, Qatar�s energy minister and president of the OPEC conference said.""This is a major step forward and we think this is a historic agreement, which will definitely help rebalance the market and reduce the stock overhang,"" Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada told a news conference in Vienna.He also said that the deal will help lift global inflation accelerate to a ""more healthy rate,"" including in the United States.It finalises a preliminary deal struck in September in Algeria when OPEC agreed to cut production but left the details to clear up later.Negotiations got bogged down in a game of poker between OPEC�s three biggest producers, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, on who would do the heavy lifting.Iraq had said it did not want to pump less crude because it was short of money to fight Daesh extremists. It also disputed how much it actually produced.Iran has only been able to freely to export oil since last year�s nuclear deal came into force in January, and wants to return to pre-sanctions output levels.Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com, said before OPEC�s announcement that Iran was ""playing a clever game"" against its arch rival.But Saudi Arabia also played hard-ball, saying it was prepared to leave the Austrian capital without a deal.Energy Minister Khaled al-Falih had said recovering demand will boost prices next year -- cut or no cut.Even though expectations were therefore low, failure to get a deal would have sent oil prices tumbling, perhaps as low as $30 per barrel, analysts had said.Also it would have reignited debate about the very purpose of OPEC, 56 years after its creation.",12/1/2016,,

Not going to happen,"" Trump told workers at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis in his first major public remarks since winning the White House.""They can leave from state to state, and negotiate deals with different states, but leaving the country will be very, very difficult,"" Trump added.During the presidential campaign, the Republican billionaire threatened to slap tariffs on firms that decamped for places like Mexico or Asia where labor costs are cheaper. It became a repeated refrain of his victorious campaign.Trump specifically singled out Carrier, a brand of United Technologies Corporation, saying he had been encouraging the company not to shift thousands of jobs to Mexico.If they did, he said his administration would impose major tariffs on Carrier products as they made their way back into the United States.""But I called Greg (Hayes, UTC�s chairman) and I said it�s really important, we have to do something because you have a lot of people leaving and you have to understand we can�t allow this to happen anymore with our country,"" Trump said as he recalled an early exchange with the firm�s top executive.Under a deal hammered out with the help of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is Indiana�s outgoing governor, the state offered Carrier $7 million in incentives over 10 years, ""contingent upon factors including employment, job retention and capital investment,"" the company said in a statement.Pence said the deal will keep about 1,100 jobs in ""the heart of the heartland.""""This is a great day for Indiana and it�s a great day for working people all across the United States of America,"" Pence said.The deal is seen as an extraordinary industry intervention by a president-elect.His supporters have described it as the first tangible part of Trump�s jobs creation plan.But liberal Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said the deal should worry Americans.Carrier ""took Trump hostage and won,"" Sanders said in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post.Trump ""endangered"" other US jobs, Sanders said, ""because he has signalled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.""",12/2/2016,,

""Surprisingly, when asked about this possibility during the press conference it appeared the oil ministers were unconcerned.""Morgan Stanley predicted it would take six to nine months for the price increase to prompt a supply response in the US, around the same time OPEC producers also are expected to ramp up.- �America First� and energy -The OPEC meeting this week also came amid a sea change in US politics as the world�s biggest economy transitions to President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed in the campaign to free the petroleum industry from burdensome restrictions.During the campaign, Trump promised to open new US lands to petroleum production, approve new pipelines, encourage offshore development and cut regulations on the industry.That cocktail of domestic policies ""could depress oil prices markedly given Trump�s promise,"" Oxford Economics said in a research note.Harold Hamm, the chief executive of shale producer Continental Resources who advised Trump on energy during the campaign, acknowledged the possibility the OPEC deal could pose problems for US producers if they restore too much production.""We have the ability to oversupply the market,"" Hamm told CNBC on Thursday. ""The key is not to.""Hamm said limited US refining capacity has pinched the industry, in part because foreign oil companies from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela own refineries in the US and are biased towards imported crude.

The cuts aim to rein in a supply glut that has weighed on markets for over two years.Meanwhile U.S. energy firms extended drilling for new oil production into a seventh month last week, data from energy services firm Baker Hughes showed on Friday.""The U.S. oil rig count continued its rally this week, up by 3 rigs...Since its trough on May 27, 2016, producers have added 161 oil rigs (+51 percent) in the U.S.,"" Goldman Sachs said.Overall - accounting for the recent rise in oil drilling, but also for cutbacks earlier this year on low prices - Goldman said ""year-on-year production will decline by 620,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2016 and increase by 55,000 bpd in 2017"".With U.S. production set to edge up, there are also gnawing concerns that the cuts announced last week by OPEC and Russia might not be as deep as initially anticipated. The planned reductions brought the sharpest weekly crude price rises in years.Russia on Friday reported average daily oil production of 11.21 million bpd for November - its highest in almost 30 years.And while Moscow has agreed to cut its output by 300,000 bpd in early 2017, it said it would do so against November levels. That means that even after a reduction, its output would remain higher than it was at the peak of the oil glut in the first half of 2016.Jeffrey Halley of brokerage OANDA in Singapore said oil traders were ""nervous (as) Russia's output has hit record levels, meaning their part of the production cut takes them back to what they were producing only quite recently"".In the Middle East, where the deepest OPEC production cuts are expected, there are also signs that production will rise before it gets cut.Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are expected to agree this month to resume oil production, with a potential of 300,000 barrels in daily output, from jointly operated oilfields which were shut down between 2014 and 2015 for environmental and technical difficulties.",12/5/2016,,

Trump campaigned against the overregulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama.The investment announced Tuesday would come from the $100 billion investment fund SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is setting up with Saudi Arabia�s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal.Trump made the announcement in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan where he met with the head of SoftBank, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he�s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,"" Trump said.""He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"" Trump later Tweeted.Prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Several other large, unnamed investors are in talks on their participation and could bring the total size of the new fund up to $100 billion, SoftBank said.Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company would create jobs by investing in startup companies in the United States.""We are going to invest $50 billion into the U.S. and commit to create 50,000 new jobs,"" Son said, adding that he saw a lot of ""deregulation"" under a Trump administration.Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump's four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration.U.S.-listed shares of SoftBank gained 3 percent to $30.99.Son had hoped to merge Sprint with T-Mobile US to take on U.S. market leaders AT&amp;T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son's comments. They closed up 1.5 percent to $8.17 in heavy trading, ending well below session highs. Shares of T-Mobile US were up 1.8 percent at $55.99.It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank's investment had been disclosed before. Softbank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion tech fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt.Whether or not Trump's election led to SoftBank's planned investment, the billionaire's victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote.Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world's largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector.SoftBank has also been stepping up investment in new areas.

Representatives for the South Korean company could not immediately be reached for comment.Kia cars had been assembled by Pakistan in the past but disappointing sales led to a halt in manufacturing.The new venture will also market and sell, besides import and export of, ""all types of Kia vehicles, parts and accessories,"" Lucky Cement told the Pakistan Stock Exchange in a statement.Kia's re-entry into Pakistan will boost government efforts to shake up the Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota (7203.T), Honda (7267.T) and Suzuki (7269.T), who assemble cars in Pakistan with local partners.Last month, French carmaker Renault agreed to invest in a new factory in Pakistan and official say they are talking to several other carmakers.The government believes increased competition should bring down exceptionally high car prices in Pakistan, and in March it introduced a new auto policy favoring new entrants into the market by offering generous import duties.The incentives have angered existing market players, some of whom have said publicly they should get similar terms.Pakistan, with a population of nearly 200 million people, is a potentially huge market, but just 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year.

Bolivia may also attend the talks, according to an OPEC source.""There's a much greater presence than we expected ... and I think countries are coming for a reason,"" Ecuadorian foreign minister Guillaume Long who is representing the OPEC member at the meeting told Reuters.So far only Russia and Oman have pledged cuts, with one OPEC source saying Mexico could also contribute as much as 150,000 bpd.In contrast, Kazakhstan plans to boost output in 2017 as it launches the long-delayed Kashagan project.Russia is expected to shoulder half of the non-OPEC cut, but on Friday sources in Moscow signaled there were snags that needed to be addressed before a deal could be reached, including full compliance with cuts by all parties involved.However, Russia's energy minister told reporters upon arriving in Vienna he expected non-OPEC oil producers to fully contribute to production cuts agreed earlier with OPEC.""I look with optimism at tomorrow's event,"" said Alexander Novak.

business,Saudi hits new oil output record in Nov amid OPEC cut ,"strong>VIENNA: Saudi Arabia pumped record-high amounts of oil in November, amid talks over a global deal to cut production, defying market expectations of lower output on slower domestic demand and refinery maintenance.</strongThe world's top oil exporter told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries it pumped 10.72 million barrels per day last month, an OPEC source said, up from 10.625 million bpd in October.In July, the kingdom's production was 10.67 million bpd, the previous high.Iraq said its November output was 4.8 million bpd, up from 4.776 million bpd in October, another OPEC source said, as oil exports reached a record high of 4.051 million bpd.Gulf OPEC member Kuwait reported output at 2.9 million bpd in November, lower than its 3 million bpd in October, while the United Arab Emirates kept its output virtually steady at 3.195 million bpd, according to official figures reported to OPEC.Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its output to 10.058 million bpd as part of an OPEC deal reached on Nov. 30 to lower the group's production to 32.5 million bpd.The rise in November means Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, will have a bigger task in complying with a plan to cut supply starting in 2017 - its first production-reduction deal since 2008.Saudi crude exports have been high in recent months, reaching 7.812 million bpd in September, while output has stayed at elevated levels despite the usual seasonal decline in winter when domestic consumption of crude burning for power is less.A Reuters survey estimated Saudi production in November at 10.45 million bpd due to reduced crude use in power plants for air-conditioning, and lower refining.A Platts OPEC survey in November estimated Saudi oil production at 10.52 million bpd.OPEC and non-OPEC producers on Saturday reached their first deal since 2001 to curtail oil output jointly and ease a global glut after more than two years of low prices.With the deal finally signed after almost a year of arguing within OPEC, the market's focus will now switch to compliance.OPEC has a long history of cheating on output quotas. The fact that Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the deal due to production-denting civil strife will further pressure OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of supply reductions.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom may be willing to cut to below 10.058 million bpd next year.",12/12/2016,,

The Fed also signaled it was likely to hike rates three more times in 2017, up from the two increases forecast at the central bank's September meeting.The projections, combined with expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration may boost domestic economic growth with fiscal stimulus, sent the dollar shooting higher and brought parity with the euro back in play.Profit-taking ahead of the weekend and expectations of a squeeze on dollar liquidity heading into year-end dampened the dollar's gains on Friday, analysts said.""The scale of the move since the FOMC meeting has been significant, and you would expect to see some kind of profit-taking on dollar longs,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut.The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.0433 after hitting a nearly 14-year low of $1.0364 on Thursday, with the current level putting it about 4 percent away from parity with the dollar. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 117.94 yen after hitting a roughly 10-1/2 month high of 118.66 yen on Thursday.Despite Friday's losses, the dollar remained on track to notch its biggest weekly percentage gains against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc in four weeks.

business,India puts fresh curbs on deposits of banned ,"NEW DELHI: India�s central bank on Monday imposed fresh restrictions on deposits of banned currency notes into bank accounts, days before the December 30 deadline to swap old rupee bills for new ones.Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed chaos last month with his shock move to withdraw high-denomination 500 ($7.50) and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation, in an effort to tackle widespread corruption and tax evasion.The decision triggered a cash crisis, with long queues materialising outside banks across the country as people tried to get rid of their old notes -- some 86 percent of all bills in circulation -- ahead of next week�s deadline.On Monday the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that people would now only be allowed to make a single deposit amounting to more than 5000 rupees ($75) before the deadline, and would be required to explain why they hadn�t deposited the money earlier.""Tenders of Specified Bank Notes (SBNs) in excess of rupees 5,000 into a bank account will be received for credit only once during the remaining period till December 30,"" the RBI said.Opposition parties attacked the move, which comes as many Indians are already facing a shortage of cash with ATMS running dry as thousands throng to them.""There are elderly, housewives, poor and students who were waiting for the long queues to become smaller,"" the opposition Congress party spokesman Randeep S. Surjewala told reporters in Delhi.""This new rule shows that Modi government has no direction or clear policy"", he added.Modi has repeatedly defended the scheme, saying it will bring billions in so-called ""black"", or undeclared, money back into the formal system.""I said this at the start, and will repeat again today, these difficulties that you have been facing will start easing after December 30,"" he said on Monday, addressing a political rally in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.The premier also hinted at more tax raids, arrests and bank scrutiny in the coming days.In the past few weeks several people have been arrested in surprise raids, revealing the role of bank officials who have allegedly facilitated the illegal exchange of old currency notes.""Some people thought that they could get away by simply depositing their unaccounted (black) money in the banks.

One key question is whether the Dow Jones will hit the 20,000 mark,"" said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of financial markets at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo.Expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will boost fiscal spending, growth and inflation have prompted investors to bet on a faster pace of U.S. rate hikes, boosting U.S. bond yields sharply.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.579 percent in Asia on Monday, near its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Thursday.As higher U.S. yields shore up the dollar, the dollar's index against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies jumped to a 14-year high of 103.56 last week.It last stood at 102.71.The euro traded at $1.0451, bouncing back from last week's low of $1.03665, its weakest since January 2003.The dollar traded at 117.80 yen, off Thursday's 10-1/2-month high of 118.66.The Australian dollar dropped to a 6-1/2-month low of $0.7267 on Friday and last stood at $0.7293, dragged by the dip in the price of copper and some other commodities.London copper hit its lowest level in more than three weeks on Friday on rising inventories and signs of softer demand from China.Oil prices held firm after Goldman Sachs boosted its price forecast for 2017 and producers showed signs of adhering to a global deal to reduce output.Brent futures rose 0.2 percent to $55.34 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.3 percent to settle at $52.06 per barrel.",12/19/2016,,

business,Chinese media advises India to ease tensions with Pak join CPEC,"strong>BEIJING: Top Chinese daily Global Times in an opinion piece has advised India to join the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to ease tensions with Pakistan and boost growth.</strongThe writer suggested that surprise aside, New Delhi should consider accepting the olive branch Pakistan has extended in a bid to participate in the CPEC.In a surprise move, Commander Southern Command Lt General Amir Riaz on Tuesday invited India to join the CPEC and �share the fruits of future development by shelving the anti-Pakistan activities and subversion�.Such an opportunity could be transient. There is a possibility that the open attitude toward India joining the CPEC will quickly be overwhelmed by opposition voices from Pakistan if New Delhi does not respond in a timely manner to the general's overture, the op-ed piece noted.The ongoing dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan makes New Delhi vigilant about the $46 billion project as it will reportedly pass through Azad Jammu and Kashmir. However, like Pakistan, India's primary strategy is to promote economic and social development. The best way to reduce hostilities is by establishing economic cooperation based on mutual benefits to put aside what cannot be reached by a consensus.China has no intention of using the CPEC as strategic leverage to intervene in Pakistan and India's dispute. On the contrary, China is likely to adopt an open attitude toward India joining the CPEC and would be happy to see more friendly interactions between the two South Asian neighbors. The CPEC has long been seen as a flagship project in China's Belt and Road initiative and India's involvement would be conducive in pushing forward the initiative.India's economy has reportedly overtaken its former colonial ruler, the UK, to become the sixth-largest in the world by GDP. Now it seems the emerging economy is pushing past these current achievements. India is ramping up efforts to integrate itself into global manufacturing chains, and as such will need to boost regional economic integration and open new international trade routes to build an export-oriented economy.India could boost its exports and slash its trade deficit with China via new trade routes that would be opened up by the CPEC. In addition, the northern part of India bordering Pakistan will gain more economic growth momentum if India joins the project.

business,Airbus seals deal with Iran for sale of 100 aircraf,"strong>PARIS: Europe's Airbus signed a firm contract on Thursday to sell 100 jets to IranAir, completing a return by Western plane giants and paving the way for deliveries to start next month, a year after sanctions against Iran were lifted.</strongThe deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic revolution.Confirming details first reported by Reuters, Airbus said almost half the jets would be for short to medium routes and that deliveries would start early next year.The contract includes 46 of the narrrow-body A320 family which includes the A321 model, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 of Europe's newest long-range model, the A350.Such a deal would be worth $18-20 billion at list prices, depending on variants flown, but Iran is expected to receive steep discounts from foreign manufacturers as its aviation renewal coincides with a drop in demand elsewhere.The head of IranAir was quoted earlier as saying the value of the contract would not exceed $10 billion.It is expected to be followed by a formal deal to buy turboprop aircraft from ATR, half-owned by Airbus.The breakthrough comes days after Iran signed a $17 billion deal with Boeing for 80 jets and is expected to sharpen efforts by the U.S. company to persuade the incoming U.S. administration to allow the trade to go ahead, aviation experts said.The first jet, an Airbus A321 already painted in IranAir livery, may arrive before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has opposed an international deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.""When Airbus and ATR aircraft start going into Iran, Boeing will point to that to argue that it should implement its own deal,"" said an aviation source who closely followed the talks.Boeing declined to comment.MOVING QUICKLYDespite rivalries, the Airbus and Boeing deals with Iran are unusually intertwined because each depends on continued U.S. clearances for the sale of planes built with U.S. parts.""Everyone has an interest in moving quickly. The Iranian government wants to show results from the nuclear deal; Airbus wants to get deliveries moving and Boeing wants the leverage it can get from European deliveries to Iran,"" another source said.The ability to renew Iran's ageing and accident-prone fleet is widely viewed as a test of the pragmatist policies of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ahead of presidential elections in May.Airbus said the deal was subject to U.S. Treasury export licences granted in September and November 2016.Republican critics of the nuclear pact want Trump to block the aircraft deals and have sought to hamper them by voting to tighten restrictions on use of the U.S. financial system.Airbus is expected to be paid in euros instead of the usual dollars and is likely to provide its own financing for the first few jets, adding to cash strains caused by a spike in customer financing for Turkey this year.Planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier called the deal ""a significant first step"" in modernising Iranian aviation, adding it included training, airport operations and air traffic management.However, both sides confirmed the Airbus A380 had been jettisoned from a provisional list first agreed in January.",12/23/2016,,

Things are much more severe in the United States,"" Veron told AFP, adding that European countries ""do not dare"" punish their national flagship companies.The American legal framework nevertheless offers the United States the means to extend the long arm of the law well beyond its borders.In the most recent cases, the United States imposed $2.6 billion in criminal penalties on the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht -- most of which will be paid to Brazil -- and a half billion on the Israeli generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical. Both matters involved corruption occurring outside the United States.The United States pioneered the prosecution of such foreign bribery cases, adopting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which allows US officials to hunt down corrupt payments abroad when the companies involved are traded on Wall Street or are otherwise exposed to US jurisdiction.In the decades since, member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have adopted similar laws but do not enforce them with the same vigor or frequency.Given the means and opportunity to apply its laws ""extraterritorially"" with such regularity, the United States has become a kind of worldwide anticorruption police force, and buttressed its geopolitical influence.""There�s a real nexus between economics and foreign affairs,"" said Aaron Klein, head of the center on regulation and markets at the Brookings Institution in Washington.""The next war is more likely to be fought with bonds than with bombs.""- Making Apple pay -In a different kind of case, Volkswagen�s sprawling emissions-cheating scandal also has shown the might of the US legal system and its ability to bring major companies to task.To compensate drivers and repair damage to the environment, the giant German automaker has agreed to pay out more than $15 billion so far, and doubtless will have to pay more before putting the scandal behind it. But the company still could face criminal charges.<br/>In Europe, authorities have also opened investigations into Volkswagen but by their own admission, the results will be much less spectacular.""In the European Union, the way to damages is more complicated than in the United States,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in September.In the United States, authorities can be supported in their actions by so-called class-action lawsuits brought collectively by groups of private individuals who have been wronged, which can ratchet up pressure on companies. But this option does exist in Europe.European authorities meanwhile have not been completely dormant in dealing with major companies. They have opened numerous anti-trust investigations and intensified their pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies.Making perhaps its biggest splash to date, the European Commission at the end of August directed the iPhone maker Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, drawing the ire of a sizeable player: the United States.",12/29/2016,,

Rouhani, who took office in 2013, is expected to seek re-election but has not announced it officially.Economists have said Trump's election in November was a major factor in the rial's weakness. He has said he will scrap the deal between Iran and world powers that imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear projects and lifted sanctions on the Iranian economy last January.""The dollar has gained against all currencies in the past few months and it is natural if it also gains in Iran. But the rate of exchange of foreign currencies will certainly not remain at current levels,"" Rouhani said, without giving details of how the government plans to defend the rial.""The stability of (currency) markets is important for the government. The economy has to be predictable so that exporters and importers can act with trust,"" he said.Before Rouhani's remarks, the rial strengthened to about 39,000 to the dollar on the free market on Sunday, after sliding to an all-time low of 41,500 last Monday.The rial's gains came after central bank Governor Valiollah Seif told state television on Saturday that he saw 36,000 rials per dollar as a ""realistic"" rate.Seif was quoted as telling lawmakers that the central bank was injecting $5.8 billion in the market to defend the rial.The currency traded at 35,570 in mid-September. Before December, the record low was about 40,000, hit in late 2012, traders said.Rouhani's administration stabilized the currency after years of volatility, which helped bring inflation down to single-digit rates from above 40 percent.Besides the free market exchange rate, Iran uses an official rate, now at 32,375, for some state transactions.",1/2/2017,,

business,Pakistans once booming textile industry struggles to bounce b,"strong>FAISALABAD: As Pakistan slowly emerges from a long-term power crisis, its once booming textile sector is scrambling to find its feet -- but high energy costs and a decade lost to competitors mean recovery is far from assured.</strongEnergy production was severely depressed for more than 10 years due to chronic under-investment, inefficiencies in the power network and an inability to collect sufficient revenue to cover costs.The result was crippling for manufacturers and in particular the textile sector, which employs 30 percent of the working population.Pakistan is the world�s fourth largest cotton producing country but interminable power and gas cuts have stopped exporters from producing their orders on time.Many have watched helplessly as their clients have instead turned to Vietnam or Bangladesh.A third of the production capacity of the sector has disappeared, thousands of factories have closed, and most of the others are running below full capacity, says Rehan Bharara, a former loom owner who now runs a public infrastructure project for the textile industry.Half the time, ""we had to run our factories on diesel generators, which was very expensive. We decided to close down rather than losing money every day,"" he said.Only those manufacturers which invested heavily in their own energy production survived.These include plants run by the Sadaqat company, which provides house linen to major Western retailers such as Debenhams, Tesco and Target. Energy supply to huge printing, cutting and sewing departments is rotated according to need.""We have three sources of electricity: the main and cheapest one is generation through gas, if we don�t have gas, we go to Wapda (the public utility), if Wapda closes, we go to diesel generators,"" says chairman Mukhtar Ahmed.""I have no choice. If I stop producing, we lose our customers.""Smaller plants, notably the hundreds of thousands of cotton loom workshops, lack backup generators and are dependent on the public network.- ""No power, no wages"" -Each time the power cuts, work is interrupted.""We loom workers only get paid if there is power and looms are running. If there is no power, there are no wages,"" said Mohammad Rizwan, a 21-year-old weaver.The government has promised to end power cuts by 2018, and said industry would be prioritised.In the past few weeks, the biggest manufacturers in Faislabad have been supplied without interruption.""The key is that they give us 24 hours of electricity a day,"" said Wahid Raamay, chairman of the Council of Loom Owners in Faisalabad.Despite these important advancements, textiles are not yet out of danger. As the country�s electricity supply has improved, natural gas imports bills have gone up with the increased cost passed down to consumers.Bharara estimates the cost of electricity has doubled over eight years, from six rupees per kilowatt/hour to 11.That�s still much lower than 26 rupees per kilowatt hour for electricity produced by a diesel generator, but more than costs in competing countries.""At this time we are struggling to give competitive power,"" admits Muhammad Salim Bhatti, general manager of the city�s power distribution company. ""Over time, we will become cheaper as new power plants will be more efficient"", he hopes. ""We�ll be in a position to compete.""But the Asian Development Bank is less optimistic, citing the opaqueness of large-scale Chinese investment in the country�s energy infrastructure.""The power due to be produced by Chinese-built power plants is expected to be expensive"" it said, though it anticipates it will still be cheaper than the thermal plants they are set to replace.In late December, Pakistan�s fourth nuclear power plant went online, built with Chinese assistance as part of Islamabad�s plans to produce 8,800 MW from atomic energy by 2030.Total exports, meanwhile, 60 percent of which are made up by textiles, declined by 13 percent in the first nine months of this year compared to last, a sign that the industry�s recovery is yet to begin.",1/8/2017,,

The export drop was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009.It will be tough for foreign trade to improve this year, especially if the inauguration of Trump and other major political changes limit the growth of China's exports due to greater protectionist measures, the country's customs agency said on Friday.""The trend of anti-globalization is becoming increasingly evident, and China is the biggest victim of this trend,"" customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters.""We will pay close attention to foreign trade policy after Trump is inaugurated president,� Huang said. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.China's trade surplus with the United States was $366 billion in 2015, according to U.S. customs data, which Trump could seize on in a bid to bring Beijing to the negotiating table to press for concessions, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a recent research note.A sustained trade surplus of more than $20 billion against the United States is one of three criteria used by the U.S. Treasury to designate another country as a currency manipulator.China is likely to point out that its own data showed the surplus fell to $250.79 billion in 2016 from $260.91 billion in 2015, but that may get short shrift in Washington.""Our worry is that Trump�s stance towards China�s trade could bring about long-term structural weakness in China�s exports,"" economists at ANZ said in a note.""Trump�s trade policy will likely motivate U.S. businesses to move their manufacturing facilities away from China, although the latter�s efforts in promoting high-end manufacturing may offset part of the loss.""On Wednesday, China may have set off a warning shot to the Trump administration. Beijing announced even higher anti-dumping duties on imports of certain animal feed from the United States than it proposed last year.""Instead of caving in and trying to prepare voluntary export restraints like Japan did with their auto exports back in the 1980s, we believe China would start by strongly protesting against the labeling with the IMF, but not to initiate more aggressive retaliation ... immediately,"" the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report said.""That said, even a 'war of words' could weaken investor confidence not only in the U.S. and China, but globally.""CHINA'S DECEMBER EXPORTS FALLChina's December exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.1 percent on-year, while imports beat forecasts slightly, growing 3.1 percent on its strong demand for commodities which has helped buoy global resources prices.An unexpected 0.1 percent rise in shipments in November, while scant, had raised hopes that China was catching up to an export improvement being seen in some other Asian economies.China reported a trade surplus of $40.82 billion for December, versus November's $44.61 billion.While the export picture has been grim all year, with shipments rising in only two months out of 12, import trends have been more encouraging of late, pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand as companies brought in more raw materials from iron ore to copper to help feed a construction boom.China imported record amounts of crude oil, iron ore, copper and soybeans in 2016, plus large volumes of coal used for heating and in steelmaking.""Trade protectionism is on the rise but China is relying more on domestic demand,"" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.Prolonged weakness in exports has forced China's government to rely on higher spending and massive bank lending to boost the economy, at the risk of adding to a huge pile of debt which some analysts warn is nearing danger levels.Data next Friday is expected to almost certainly show that 2016 economic growth hit Beijing's target of 6.5-7 percent thanks to that flurry of stimulus.But signs are mounting that the red-hot property market may have peaked, meaning China may have less appetite this year for imports of building-related materials.""It is hard to see what could drive a more substantial recovery in Chinese trade,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.""Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth. Instead, the risks to trade lie to the downside...,"" he said, saying the chance of a damaging China-U.S. trade spat has risen since Trump's appointment of hardliners to lead trade policy.A decline in China's trade surplus in 2016, to just under $510 billion from $594 billion in 2015, may also reduce authorities' ability to offset capital outflow pressures, which have helped drive its yuan currency to more than eight-year lows, ANZ economists said.",1/13/2017,,

But inequality matters and you cannot have a system where billionaires are systematically paying lower rates of tax than their secretary or cleaner,"" Lawson said.Oxfam bases its calculations on data from Swiss bank Credit Suisse and Forbes.

business,Taiwan economy rallies thanks to electronics demand,"Taipei: Taiwan�s economy notched up its best performance in almost two years in the final quarter of 2016, with strong demand for electronics offsetting a plunge in mainland tourists, according to official data released Wednesday.Growth was 2.58 percent year-on-year in the September-December period, the fastest expansion since the first-quarter of 2015 when the economy grew 4.01 percent.It was the third consecutive quarter of growth since Taiwan came out of recession in April-June last year.Traditionally an export-driven technology hub, the island is home to industry giants such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) -- key suppliers for Apple�s iPhone.President Tsai Ing-wen is pushing for Taiwan to foster its own ""Asian Silicon Valley"" as one of her five initiatives to kickstart the economy.The statistics bureau said exports in the quarter increased 11.73 percent -- the most in five years -- driven by a boom in demand for electronics parts.TSMC also announced earlier this month better-than-expected earnings in the same period thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7 series.""Production of electronic components continue to increase, driven by the expansion of smart technology product applications,"" the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said in a statement Wednesday.However, growth has been dampened by slowing tourism from mainland China, that saw a drop of 40.39 percent in the fourth quarter.The number of Chinese visitors has fallen since Beijing-sceptic Tsai was elected last January, with speculation China is turning off the taps as a means of pressure on the Taiwanese leader.Local tourism operators who once catered to droves of mainland tourists complain of half-empty hotels and tour buses sitting idle.While tourism to Taiwan from other countries rose 17.47 percent in the fourth quarter, overall visitor numbers still declined 3.99 percent.Analysts are also concerned about whether the strong export demand will continue. <br/> ""With weak global demand set to drag on exports and limited scope for more policy support, the recovery is likely to run out of steam soon,"" Capital Economics economist Gareth Leather said, according to Bloomberg News.Wednesday�s release brings 2016 full-year growth to 1.4 percent, beating the government�s estimate of 1.35 percent.It is forecasting economic growth of 1.87 percent in 2017.",1/25/2017,,

All the three parties are in discussions about how to resolve disagreements over the interpretation of the treaty�s provisions in the context of India�s construction of two hydroelectric power plants.�India and Pakistan are important partners and clients of the World Bank Group. We have longstanding relationships in support of their goals to improve education, create jobs, transform their energy sectors, and improve people�s lives,� said Georgieva.�I look forward to meeting leaders from both countries to gain a deeper understanding of their development goals as well as to fully appreciate all perspectives related to the Indus Waters Treaty,� she added.This week, Georgieva, who started her new job on January 2, will meet the senior leadership of Pakistan to discuss how best to support the country in making the most of its economic potential, according to a statement from the World Bank. She will also be visiting project sites and talking with people benefiting from the World Bank�s support.The World Bank in December announced a pause in the separate processes initiated by India and Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty to allow the two countries to consider alternative ways to resolve their differences, in line with the spirit of the treaty.Georgieva is accompanied by Annette Dixon, Vice President for the South Asia Region of the World Bank.The Bank delivered 50 projects totaling $8.8 billion in the 2016 financial year (ending June 30), as a whole in South Asia, including $5.1 billion of International Development Association commitments, of which $225 million went to the IDA Scale-up Facility and $3.6 billion in loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).Lending included such transformational operations as the $1.5 billion Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation, which seeks to end open defecation in India; and a $920 million package of IDA and IBRD funding that supports competitiveness and structural reform in Pakistan.",1/26/2017,,
business,WTO 1 trillion global trade treaty,"strong>GENEVA: A trade accord that will boost global exports by $1 trillion should come into force within two weeks, the head of the World Trade Organization said on Thursday, just as the rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump clouds the outlook for global trade.</strongThe Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) will have a major impact on poorer countries, because it standardises and simplifies customs procedures, slashing the time, cost and complexity of taking goods over borders.""In the WTO's history, it is the biggest agreement we ever reached,"" WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told Reuters in an interview.Jordan, Chad and Kuwait are all poised to ratify, which would tip the agreement over the required mark of 110 WTO members to take effect, Azevedo said.""There are estimates that once fully implemented, this could have an impact of around 2.7 percentage points on trade expansion throughout the world every year until say 2030, and half a percentage point of GDP growth around the world.""Where a product may previously have taken 6-7 weeks to arrive, the waiting time should be cut to a few days.""Things are going to cross the border much more easily, much more transparently and at lower costs,"" Azevedo said.""If it�s truly implemented and done well, there will be almost no contact between the client and the (customs) authority,"" Azevedo said. ""When that happens the room for corruption basically disappears. And we know that at the border, corruption is a problem for many countries.""The United States, European Union, China and Japan were among the early adopters, although big and rich countries have less to gain since their customs procedures are already at high levels.Asked if the deal was the high point of global trade liberalisation, the veteran Brazilian trade negotiator said there was still a ""rich agenda"" of potential trade reforms, including for investment, services and small business.Azevedo said it was too early to tell whether the new U.S. administration would be on board with those reforms, adding that much of what was being said about Trump's plans for trade was speculation inferred from his previous comments.Trump has advocated an ""America first"" stance, and talked of introducing border taxes to stop manufacturing jobs going to Mexico or China, prompting fears of a trade war between major economic blocs.strong>""VERY BAD SCENARIO""</strongAzevedo said there could be an increase in trade disputes, and the WTO was ready to handle them.""A lot of concerns I�ve heard in recent political debates in the United States can be addressed by tools that we have here in the WTO.""But a trade war that involved ignoring the rules-based system would be a ""very bad scenario"".The outlook for world trade growth was hard to foresee because of conflicting signals, Azevedo said, with some people worried about a trade war and others anticipating an accelerating U.S. economy and improving business environment.The WTO is also an important arena for Britain's discussions about its exit from the European Union, because the EU looks after Britain's rights and obligations as a trading entity at the WTO. Britain must disentangle itself so it can negotiate as a separate entity at the WTO.""I suppose, from what I hear, that it is going to take a couple of years, at least. At that point in time they will begin to negotiate with WTO members,"" Azevedo said.Asked if that might interfere with Britain's plan to leave the EU in two years, he said: �Timing is not in my hands. It�s in members� hands � and the political decision to initiate things.�Britain could start to negotiate with WTO members sooner, Azevedo said, but he had not heard of such negotiations and he had not been approached to facilitate anything.",1/27/2017,,
business,Iran oil exports rise slightly Feb sour,"strong>TOKYO: Iran's monthly oil exports are set to climb slightly in February, as Indonesia takes its first shipment since sanctions on Tehran were lifted last year, a person with knowledge of Iran's tanker loading schedule said.</strongVolumes remain below last September's high, however, suggesting that Iran has had difficulty finding more buyers for its oil, even after being exempt from production cuts agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other exporters last November.Traders had expected it to raise output slightly and boost exports to reclaim market share.Crude and condensate exports for February will be just over 2.20 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 2.16 million bpd this month, which is the lowest rate since July, the person said. Exports rose to as high as nearly 2.6 million bpd in September.While crude and condensate exports have slipped, Iran is planning to significantly boost oil product exports this year as it refurbishes refineries, said Abbas Kazemi, Iran's deputy minister of petroleum and president of its national oil refining company NIORDIC.""In 2017 I see about 600,000 barrels per day of oil product exports. That is the plan,"" Kazemi told Reuters at an oil conference in Tokyo on Thursday.Products will include fuel oil, gasoil and kerosene, he said.Crude oil loadings for Asia, where Iran's biggest customers are located, are set to rise to a three-month high of nearly 1.5 million bpd in February. Loadings for January, meanwhile, have been running a little above 1.46 million bpd.Indonesia is expected to lift nearly 34,000 bpd in February, according to the source.Exports to Europe are set to total a little more than 610,000 bpd in January and nearly 590,000 in February, compared with a high of almost 800,000 bpd in December, the most since the sanctions were lifted.The Netherlands is lifting its first crude and loading nearly 70,000 bpd this month, according to the source. It earlier bought condensate from Iran.That ties in with information from oil trading and shipping sources who told Reuters that two Iranian-owned oil tankers are sailing to Rotterdam, the heart of northern Europe's refining and trading hub.The development shows Iran breaking through yet another barrier in its bid to regain oil market share lost during years of international sanctions that hindered its sale of crude oil and condensates to the international market.Iran had been ramping up shipments of oil on foreign owned tankers since restrictions on ship insurance were eased last April. They will be eased further from next month.In the last month supertankers owned by Greek and Croatian owners have hauled Iranian crude from Kharg Island to Spain, Italy and Thailand according to ship tracking data on the Reuters Eikon terminal.Italy is loading about 32,000 bpd in January and nearly 110,000 bpd in February, while Spain is loading a similar amount in January and just above 70,000 bpd in February.""Italy and Spain used to be quite enthusiastic buyers of Iranian crude ...

In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers.China is one of the Western manufacturers� key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers.The country�s airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast.Boeing�s expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion.To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft.Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers.Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said.COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June.",2/6/2017,,

The change means that the fund will receive dividends from the assets rather than the government budget, he said in a note to clients.Turkey is following in the steps of several countries in putting key national assets into a sovereign wealth fund, which can be used for major projects, maintaining pensions and national welfare programmes, or in times of crisis.But Ankara�s fund is well behind the biggest sovereign wealth funds in Norway, the Gulf and China.Norway�s sovereign wealth fund is the world�s largest, worth $892 billion and holding stakes in around 9,000 companies worldwide.When Turkey�s fund was founded in August, the state-run Anadolu news agency said it would be used to fund ""mega projects"" such as the planned Istanbul shipping canal and a new three-level tunnel under the Bosphorus.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fondly refers to such plans as his ""crazy projects"" aimed at transforming infrastructure to create a ""new Turkey"".Anadolu said in August the fund aimed eventually to have a value of $200 billion.",2/6/2017,,

PPP determines the economic productivity and standards of living of various countries over a period. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, many economists consider PPP as a more precise way of estimating a country�s economy.The consulting firm also predicted 2050 GDP numbers based on market exchange ratings, an alternative method for GDP calculation. In these rankings, the US will lose global dominance by 2030, and the gap will only grow by 2050 with China having a nearly $50 trillion GDP, and the US having the same $34.1 trillion.Following is the list of top 32 economies by 2030:01.

business,Enjoy the first movers advantage Nawaz advises business leader,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday said Pakistan was set on track of sustainable growth and was ready to do business with the world.</strong�Pakistan with its sixth largest population in the world, 80 million middle class, blessed with human and natural resources, strategically located, politically stable, offering attractive policies is a destination no global player can miss,� the prime minister said in a meeting with heads of international organizations, here at the PM Office.The group of corporate leaders that attended the meeting belonged to the United States, Australia, China, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden, Singapore, Germany, South Korea and Switzerland.The prime minister urged upon the foreign businessmen to avail the country�s investment potential and �enjoy the first mover�s advantage�.Nawaz Sharif apprised the businessmen that Pakistan�s economic conditions were improving continuously with an objective to achieve 5 percent GDP growth rate from the current 3 percent.He said the government was aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth and mentioned several steps taken in this regard including strengthened tax administration, rationalize untargeted annual subsidies and widened social safety nets.He said these steps reinforced macroeconomic policies, which resulted in lower budget deficit, increased foreign exchange reserves, and low spending on energy subsidies.The prime minister said the government was cognizant of the need for a comprehensive and contemporary policy framework that supported macroeconomic stability.�We are well aware that international investors need stable markets backed by clear and consistent policies. We are committed to maintaining an enabling policy framework to attract foreign direct investment,� he said.He said the Vision 2025 mapped Pakistan to join the top 25 economies in the world leading to Upper Middle Income country status by 2025.He said the country�s economy was targeted to grow over 8 percent between 2018 and 2025 while maintaining single digit inflation.He mentioned that PricewaterhouseCoopers had placed Pakistan at 20 in its projected list of 32 most powerful economies of the world in 2030.The prime minister said as a result of sustained commitment to reform, key economic indicators had improved since the government was elected in 2013.Over the past three years, the government brought down the fiscal deficit from 8.6 to 4.2 percent, increased Tax-to-GDP ratio from 9.8 to 12.4 percent and investment to GDP ratio from 14.9 to 15.2 percent, he added.He mentioned that inflation had been contained which had earlier touched 1.6 percent in October 2015 and had remained well under 3 percent since then.He said industrial sector showed remarkable performance and registered a growth of 6.8 percent during 2015-16 and was poised to do even better this year and onwards.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said since he came into office in 2013, the economy faced severe energy shortages, inflationary pressures, exchange rate volatility and a precarious security environment.He said however at present, the consumer market in Pakistan was growing at a very fast pace including automobiles, housing, electronics, telecommunication, hospitality and online-retails sectors.He said Pakistan was emerging as an expanding market for the US and European products.He mentioned that the government had devised a comprehensive plan to create investment friendly environment, particularly liberalized investment policies to welcome foreign investments.�We offer incentives to attract new capital inflows, including tax exemptions, tariff reductions, infrastructure, and investor facilitation services,� he said.He said the Investment Policy (2013) focused at reducing the cost of doing business in Pakistan, easing business with creation of industrial clusters and Special Economic Zones to attract foreign direct investment, all protected by legislation.Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan Stock Exchange had been created to lower fragmentation of the market and bring it at par with global markets.�The bench mark index PSE100, crossed 49,000 in January 2017 and is touching new heights. Recently, 40 percent strategic shares of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) were sold to a Chinese consortium,� he added.He pointed that this divestment was the first such sale in a bourse in the regional markets and it also marks first venture of Chinese bourse outside China.The PM also apprised the foreign businessmen of Pakistan�s strategic location on Asia�s premier trade, energy and transport corridor.�It is also the gateway to the energy rich Central Asian States, the financially liquid Gulf States and the economically advanced Far Eastern economies,� he said.He said China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a key regional initiative for connectivity and shared prosperity of nations.He said under CPEC, a portfolio of over US$55 billion had already been implemented while investment of more than US$35 billion in the energy sector was also being implemented.He said the corridor would substantially shorten transportation distances between Africa and Middle-East to Central and South Asian regions.The prime minister said international economic agencies were upgrading ratings for the financial and economic stability of Pakistan.He mentioned that Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) had upgraded its forecast of average annual GDP growth from 4.7 to 5 percent, World Bank forecast a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2016-17, S &amp; P also expected Pakistan�s debt to fall below 60 percent of GDP by 2018.The CEOs from UK included Henry Cookson, MD Henry Cookson Adventures, Britain; Julia Charlotte Chastel De Boinville, Clint Programme Manager Afiniti; George Justin Murray, MD Afiniti; Christopher Malcolm Farmer, EVP Afiniti; Thomas Hampden Inskip, MD Afiniti; Archibald Soames, Sr Manager Afiniti; Julian Lopez Portillo, Client Programme Manager Afiniti and Max Cooper Lintott, Client Program Manager Afiniti.The business leaders from USA included Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti, CEO the Resource Group and Hassan Afzal, Chief Technology Officer Afiniti.The business leaders from Italy included Alessandro Benetton, CEO Benetton Autostrade Pvt Equity; Carlo D� Amelio, CEO Sant� Anna-Holding Ibl Bancal-Spa; Fabio Corsico, Govt Affairs Director Kolon Group; Marco Alvera, CEO Snam; Cecilia Braggiotti, MD Afiniti and Lucia Baresi, Client Programme Manager Afiniti.The CEOs from China included Sichen Huang, Afiniti Advisor; Guo Ping, CEO Huawei; Linchun Chin, Youghi Yang, Jin Yi Hugo Ou, Non ED Sinolink Worldwide Holdings, China.The CEOs from other countries included Raymond Lee, Owner Kolon Group (South Korea); Rob Rankin, Chairman Consolidated Press Holdings and Roy Wyatt Beau, Client Programme Manager Afiniti (Australia); Lai Chang Wen, CEO Ninja Van and Li Huanwu, GM Afiniti and Hua Qianni, Centre Director (East China) (Singapore Consulate); Tanguy Catlin, Senior Partner Mckinsey and Jerome Geo.M.F.de la Croix de Castries, Country Manager Afiniti (France); Alonso Aznar Botella, Silent Programme Manager (Spain); Benedict Constantin Faber, GM Afiniti (Germany); Michel Grorges Portenier, EVP Afiniti (Switzerland); Timothy Gordon Raymond Nixon, GM Afiniti (Canada); Justyna Hanna Kozicki (Sweden) and Ali Raza Siddiqi, Director JS Group and Nadeem A.

business,Oil pares gains as US supply concerns overshadow OPEC cu,"strong>NEW YORK: Oil pared gains on Tuesday as concerns about rising supply from U.S. shale output overshadowed an OPEC-led effort to cut global output, which has supported oil prices in a higher range.</strongBrent crude was 61 cents higher at $56.20 a barrel by 11:30 Eastern (1530 GMT), after earlier rising to $56.46 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 45 cents at $53.38.The two benchmarks fell 2 percent on Monday. They are both now near the middle of $5-per-barrel trading ranges seen since early December.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017 in a bid to rein in a global fuel supply overhang.The market has largely priced in the production cuts that OPEC and other producers agreed to in November, leaving little room for prices to break out of the range, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital in New York.""It would take either a supply outage or serious cuts to move it,"" he said. ""The first month, obviously, OPEC is going to do the best it can, but after that, let's see what the second and third month bring.""Rising production in the United States, where increased drilling activity especially by shale oil producers, has undermined these efforts. U.S. crude output is up 6.5 percent since mid-2016 to 8.98 million bpd, its highest level since April last year.U.S. shale oil production for March is expected to rise by the most in five months to 4.87 million bpd, its highest rate of since May last year, government data showed on Monday.""Oil just appears to be caught in a range at the moment and mainly focused on those supply considerations,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.Although OPEC countries are largely sticking to their agreement with compliance around 90 percent, investors suspect the cuts may not be maintained, preventing them from having a bigger impact on prices.""OPEC producers want the market to believe they will stick to the agreed production freeze (cut). But lessons from the past have made the market deeply suspicious,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO Bank in Amsterdam.Many analysts say oil producers will have to cut production more quickly to drain the global oversupply this year.""Based on OPEC�s own numbers the message is loud and clear,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM Oil Associates.""Improve on compliance, cut production further and extend the deal for the second half of the year if you want to avoid yet another year of global oil inventory builds.""",2/14/2017,,

""Indeed the whole world benefits from a strong EU.""Trudeau, who will also visit Germany, said that Canada and the European Union shared a belief in democracy, transparency and the rule of law, in human rights, inclusion and diversity.""We know that, in these times, we must choose to lead the international economy, not simply be subject to its whims,"" he said, according to a text made available in advance of his speech, adding both parties had shown they valued trade and a belief that it could bring prosperity to their citizens.With the passage of their trade deal, Canada and the European Union offer a counter to Trump, who has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and wants to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.For Canada the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is important to reduce its reliance on the neighbouring United States as an export market.For the EU, it is a first trade pact with a G7 country and a success to hail after months of protests at a time when the bloc's credibility has taken a beating from Britain's vote last June to leave.Trudeau's speech, in English and French, got a warm welcome from lawmakers in Strasbourg as he signalled Canada's distance from both its big neighbour to the south under Trump and from London, where Brexit supporters argue that ties to Britain's old empire can help expand trade once out of the European Union.Both Canada and the EU, said Trudeau, needed to ensure that their Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), set to enter force in months, worked for people.""If we are successful, CETA will become the blueprint for all ambitious, future trade deals. If we are not, this could very well be the last. So make no mistake, this is an important moment for us.""Trudeau said many people were worried that the current system only benefited society's luckiest few and that this was a valid concern.Trade, he said, must be inclusive, so that everyone benefited.""And this agreement ... delivers just that.""",2/16/2017,,

""The question is, which of these is going to give first?""Brent and WTI have traded within a $5 per barrel price range this year, in what has become the longest and most range-bound period since a price slump began in mid-2014.In the United States, rising output has helped push up crude and fuel stocks to record highs.In Asia, oil flows into the region remain as high as they were before the production cuts, Thomson Reuters data shows, as exporters fight for market share.And there are also signs of faltering demand growth in core markets, China and India.In India, fuel demand growth fell in January, while in China sagging car sales and soaring gasoline and diesel exports also point to a slowdown in growth.That leaves Europe, where OPEC has significantly cut its sales. But Thomson Reuters data shows rising North Sea oil exports to Asia, indicating there is no real supply shortage in the region.Despite the supply glut, analysts expect oil markets to tighten in the longer term.""In the fourth quarter of 2018, global oil demand will most likely surpass 100 million barrels per day,"" AB Bernstein said on Friday in a note to clients.""If oil prices stay around $60 per barrel and GDP growth over 3 percent per annum, then oil demand growth will be stronger over the next 5 years, than the previous decade.

This situation was much better in January than in previous years,"" tourism ministry spokeswoman Omaima al-Husseini said.Visitors from China, Japan and Ukraine account for a large part of the growth.China�s top public travel agency, China International Travel Service, reported a 58 percent increase in tourists flying to Egypt compared with 2015.""There are more bookings between October 2016 and January 2017 than last year,"" said Egyptian Federation of Tourism chief Karim Mohsen.""There is an improvement, especially in cultural tourism in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan,"" key historical sites, he said.The uptick is a sign of hope for a country also reeling from the shock of an economic reform programme that has triggered massive inflation.Once a key foreign currency earner, the tourism sector crashed in 2011 after a popular uprising overthrew veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak, ushering in years of sporadic unrest.Recoveries in the sector since then have been set back by new crises.In June 2015, a massacre of tourists at a Luxor temple was narrowly averted when assailants armed with assault rifles and explosives bungled the attack and were intercepted by police.But in October that year, Islamic State group jihadists, who are waging an insurgency in the eastern Sinai Peninsula, struck again. They bombed a Russian airliner carrying holidaymakers home from the popular Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.All 224 people on board were killed.Russia suspended flights to Egypt and Britain cut air links with Sharm el-Sheikh.Visitor numbers plunged from 9.3 million in 2015 to 5.3 million the following year, Husseini said.",2/19/2017,,

""And today, all routes lead back to Gwadar.""Gwadar forms the southern Pakistan hub of a $57-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) of infrastructure and energy projects Beijing announced in 2014.Since then, land prices have skyrocketed as property demand has spiked, and dozens of real estate firms want to cash in.""Gwadar is a 'Made in China' brand and everyone wants a piece,"" said realtor Afzal Adil, one of several who shifted operations from the eastern city of Lahore in 2015.Last year, Pakistan welcomed the first large shipment of Chinese goods at Gwadar, where the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd took over operations in 2013. It plans to eventually handle 300 million to 400 million tons of cargo a year.It also aims to develop seafood processing plants in a nearby free trade zone sprawled over 923 hectares (2,281 acres).The route through Gwadar offers China its shortest path to the oil-rich Middle East, Africa, and most of the Western hemisphere, besides promising to open up remote, landlocked Xinjiang.Last year, the Applied Economics Research Centre estimated the corridor would create 700,000 jobs in Pakistan and a Chinese newspaper recently put the number at more than 2 million.Authorities have completed an expressway through Gwadar, which has a 350-km (218-mile) road network. A new international airport kicks off next year, to handle an influx of hundreds of Chinese traders and officials expected to live near the port.The volume of Gwadar property searches surged 14-fold on Pakistan's largest real estate database, Zameen.com, between 2014 and 2016, up from a prior rate of a few hundred a month.""It's like a gold rush,"" said Chief Executive Zeeshan Ali Khan.

""We are trying to upgrade as fast as we can,"" said Zakir Majeed, an official of the Gwadar Development Authority (GDA).But Gwadar lacks basic education and health facilities, in contrast to the gleaming towers and piped drinking water of the ""smart city"" envisioned by the GDA.""For commercial projects, things are moving fast,"" Lamudi's Arshed said.

business,Investment inflows spur Pakistans corporate sukuk mar,"strong>Growth of sharia-compliant investment funds in Pakistan is helping fuel demand for sukuk, or Islamic bonds, giving local firms new funding options while strengthening the case for Islamic pensions in other majority-Muslim countries.</strongStrong demand for Islamic funds, and in turn sukuk, could encourage other countries trying to deepen their Islamic capital markets, in particular in the Gulf region where private pensions are rare.Pakistan's Islamic banks lag their conventional peers, holding around 13 percent of total deposits, while Islamic mutual funds and private pensions have a far greater market share.Islamic mutual funds held 242.7 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) in assets as of December, or 37 percent of the total, official statistics show.Almost two-thirds of assets in the country's voluntary pension system (VPS) are now managed under Islamic principles.All 10 VPS managers offer Islamic pension products, worth a combined 14.5 billion rupees, or 63 percent of total VPS assets with the largest VPS product being sharia-compliant.Attractive yields, tax exemptions and greater flexibility in choosing external managers have made VPS products popular, which in turn adds to demand for sukuk, said Abdullah Ghaffar, head of investment banking at Al Baraka Bank Pakistan.""Mutual funds, both fixed income as well as equity funds, have become big time investors in existing and new sukuk issues taking place because of the huge assets under management under their disposal.""Two recent sukuk transactions from manufacturing companies attracted significant interest from such investment funds, while equity funds are also becoming active in initial public offerings, Ghaffar added.Reforms from Pakistan's capital market regulator have also helped equity-like financing vehicles, known as modarabas, to grow their combined assets above 41 billion rupees.INCENTIVESIslamic funds screen their portfolios according to religious guidelines such as bans on tobacco, alcohol and gambling, similar to socially responsible funds in Western markets.They must also adhere to Islam's ban on interest payments, which confines them to sukuk for their fixed-income investments, a relatively small market where demand has traditionally exceeded supply.Tax changes have also helped sukuk issuance. In September, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue granted sukuk similar tax treatment to conventional bonds.This has attracted a wide range of issuers: Byco Oil Pakistan Limited raised 3.12 billion rupees via sukuk using a credit gurantee and Ghani Gases raised 1.3 billion rupees via a privately-placed sukuk last month.In December, Fatima Fertilizer Company mandated banks to raise 10.5 billion rupees through a lease-based sukuk.Pakistan GasPort Consortium Limited plans to raise 8.6 billion rupees via seven-year sukuk to finance the construction of the country's second LNG import terminal.",3/2/2017,,

The Joint Ministerial Commission provides the best platform to take stock of bilateral cooperation in various economic sectors and setting new benchmarks to carry this cooperation forward.Referring to the level of bilateral trade between the two countries, the prime minister reiterated that this needed to be further enhanced to its fullest potential. Encouraging greater private sector interaction could enhance the existing level of trade as well as bridge the imbalance in existing trade patterns.Nawaz Sharif said over 114,000 Pakistanis live in Kuwait which was evidence of the strong ties existing between the two countries. It also confirmed the immense importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Kuwait.Nawaz Sharif also emphasized the importance of early resumption of GCC- Pakistan Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the support of Kuwait and most importantly spoke of the need for lifting of visa restrictions as it would remove a major hurdle in freedom of movement for the business community.He stressed that Pakistan was an investment friendly country and an attractive destination for foreign investors, due to its liberal investment policy and high rate of return.There are ample opportunities for investors, with one hundred percent equity or joint ventures in Pakistan. Over 1,000 leading multinational companies are currently successfully operating in various sectors of our economy.The Prime Minister said there were a number of energy and infrastructure development projects in Pakistan that could be considered by foreign investors. He said we would welcome further investments from Kuwait in mega infrastructure and energy projects being undertaken in Pakistan.Earlier, Nawaz Sharif was accorded a warm welcome upon arrival at the Bayan Palace with Guard of Honor.Meanwhile, talking to Speaker of Kuwaiti Parliament Marzouq Al-Ghanim in Kuwait City, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for greater parliamentary exchanges between Pakistan and Kuwait.He said these exchanges will enhance relations between the two countries.Speaker Marzouq briefed the Prime Minister about the proceeding of Kuwaiti Parliament.",3/7/2017,,

The B&amp;R initiative is a vital combination of geo-economics and geo-strategy.The Belt and Road (B&amp;R) is an innovative paradigm of global integration involving 65 countries, including one-third of the world�s GDP, impacting 65 percent of the world�s population and a quarter of all the goods and services, the website observed.Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in late 2013. It comprises the �Belt,� which is a network of roads across the world, and �the Road� which is actually a network of shipping lanes and ports.The project has a geo-strategic component focused on advancing China�s economic goals and utilizing its industrial potential. It serves to remove China�s dependence on the Malacca Strait for oil imports, improves trade connectivity, furthers China�s foreign policy and minimizes conflicts as it reconnects the world.This project of the century has kept the world economy afloat since 2013 by withstanding the crash of the trans-Atlantic banking systems.As PricewaterhouseCoopers reports, the �real value� in China�s economy and its investments in countries along its Belt and Road initiative is shifting to infrastructure projects and rising at a rapid pace.The B&amp;R is to be financed mainly by the Silk Road Fund and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Additionally, the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership provides Beijing with the perfect opportunity to re-integrate Asian investment that used to find its way to American banks.Further prospects and direction of the B&amp;R initiative will be determined at the �two sessions� as the project is an integral part of China�s new reforms and an intrinsic part of its foreign policy.China is going to hold the Belt and Road forum this May and it would be a masterstroke by China if more countries like U.S. and India announce their participation or signal their approval with their presence at this forum; the great game is never really over and there is much more scope in Chinese wisdom and peaceful globalization in the Eurasian Century.",3/7/2017,,

Xinjiang was once a key transportation and trade hub on the ancient Silk Road.During this year's annual session of the National People's Congress, the Xinjiang delegation proposed the construction of high-speed railways linking the regional capital of Urumqi and southern Xinjiang's Kashgar, the starting point of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as well as another one connecting Urumqi and northern Xinjiang's Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border.The delegation also proposed starting construction on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which has long been discussed and planned. The national lawmakers from Xinjiang believe it is urgent to start construction on the railway to enhance economic cooperation with the two Central Asian countries.A total of 223 westbound trains carrying construction materials, agricultural produce, garments and other merchandise traveled via nine cross-border routes linking Xinjiang to Central Asian countries in 2016, said Hu Kaijiang, director of the Xinjiang Economic and Information Commission.This year, Xinjiang plans to expand operations to run 400 westbound cross-border trains to facilitate exports of technology and equipment and seek new growth opportunities, Hu said.Geographic location, rich natural resources and preferential policies introduced to encourage opening-up have given Xinjiang advantages in becoming the core area on the economic belt, Shokrat said. Becoming a key player on the economic belt will also benefit the region's social development.Besides improving its transportation network, the region will focus on the development of key cities along the economic belt. Xinjiang aims to achieve more than 7 percent economic growth this year and to see ""substantial"" progress in making the region serve as the transportation, logistic, financial, cultural and medical center on the modern Silk Road, he added.",3/17/2017,,

It has five coal-fired units with a total installed capacity of 845,000 kilowatts and heating capacity of 26 million square meters.Du Chengzhang, general manager of the plant, said it is an efficient and environmental friendly plant with advanced emission treatment equipment. The plant has provided important support to the stable operation of Beijing's electric power system and the heat-supply system.After the suspension of the plant, about 1.76 million tonnes of coal, 91 tonnes of sulfur dioxide and 285 tonnes of nitrogen oxide emissions will be cut annually.According to a clean air plan by Beijing from 2013 to 2017, Beijing will build four gas thermal power centers and shut down the four large coal-fueled thermal power plants during the period.Another three plants which used to consume over 6.8 million tonnes of coal each year were closed in 2014 and 2015.Du said Huangneng will prepare to serve as an emergency heat source for the capital's heating system after operations cease.Three of the four gas thermal power have already been built and are in use.Beijing has 27 power plants, all fueled by clean energy with a total installed capacity of 11.3 million kilowatts.According to the city's plan, Beijing will build no more large-scale power plants.",3/19/2017,,

business,For Turkish giant Arcelik Pakistan is among focus ar,"strong>LONDON: Arcelik, the home appliances arm of Turkey's biggest industrial conglomerate Koc Holding, is working on acquisitions to speed up its international expansion, particularly in Asia, its chief executive said on Monday.</strongThe company, which sells washing machines, dryers and refrigerators under labels including Beko and Grundig, wants more such ""white goods"" brands, but could also look at small appliances such as coffee makers and food processors.""(M&amp;A) is important because we have global ambitions,"" CEO Hakan Bulgurlu told Reuters in an interview in London.He forecast ""significant demand growth"" in southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as Bangladesh, Pakistan and India.""They're all focus areas for us,"" he said.Geography is a much more important factor than price, Bulgurlu added. Arcelik could easily do another deal like last year's roughly $250 million purchase of Pakistan's Dawlance, but could also do something several times bigger, he said.""We're opportunistic. We're not restricted on size in any way.""Bulgurlu said international markets should account for 65 percent of Arcelik's sales this year, up from 60 percent in 2016, reaching 80 percent in a few years.Europe currently accounts for the large majority of international sales, though the company has a growing presence in Africa through its 2011 purchase of South Africa's Defy Appliances.GLOBAL UNCERTAINTYBulgurlu stood by Arcelik's forecast for revenue to grow 20 percent this year from 16.10 billion Turkish lira ($4.43 billion) in 2016, even though its overall home market could grow faster than the 3 percent it had previously forecast.The stronger market in Turkey is due to a recent government move to reduce a tax on white goods in order to spur demand. Still, the weak lira has made raw materials such as oil, steel and plastic more expensive, impacting profitability.""There's a lot of uncertainty in the world,"" Bulgurlu said, also citing the weak pound that has caused inflationary pressure in Britain, which accounts for 10 percent of sales.The company had to raise prices on some UK products and expects that to temper demand, especially after there was a surge due to expectations of future price rises.""I think demand will taper off a little,"" Bulgurlu said, noting however that Arcelik still aimed to double its business in Britain in the next five years, even as the country's exit from the European Union raises questions about the economy and the future of foreign workers.""It will continue to be our most important market outside Turkey,"" he said.Arcelik opened a research and development center in Cambridge, eastern England, last year, in an effort to take advantage of a British tradition for scientific innovation.""We want to tap into that and take that pure research and make it applicable to appliances,"" Bulgurlu said, citing potential for smart appliances such as refrigerators that know when food is going bad and ovens that can keep food cool until its time to cook.",3/21/2017,,
business,Saudis to tighten curbs on foreign workers in local jobs pu,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said. It is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 3, one source said, declining to be named because an official announcement has not yet been made.",3/21/2017,,

The multilevel coaches will meet ""Buy America"" requirements, with 60 percent or more of the parts, labor and fabrication done in the US.CRRC MA came in with a low bid of $137.5 million, easily besting competitors Bombardier, which bid $171.5 million and the $187.8 million bid by Hyundai Rotem.CRRC MA's deal includes an option for 10 more cars, which, if exercised, would result in the contract's value rising to $161 million, still below the base bids by Bombardier and Hyundai Rotem.The first of the coaches are expected to be delivered in late 2019. They will be paired with SEPTA's new electric locomotives, which are being built by Siemens of Germany.<br/>The multilevel coaches will be produced primarily at CRRC MA's main US manufacturing facility in Springfield, Massachusetts.It is the latest win for CRRC.

US officials would not specify how long the ban will last, but Dubai-based Emirates told AFP that it had been instructed to enforce it until at least October 14.Travellers using 10 airports across the Middle East and North Africa are subject to the ban.The ban also covers all electronics sold at Dubai Duty Free, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths told local radio earlier this week.Government-owned Emirates operates 18 flights daily to the United States out of Dubai. In an attempt to appease its customers, the airline announced it would be offering complimentary packing and shipping services at gates to enable passengers to use their electronic devices after check-in and until boarding.Adding to the complication on Saturday, a number of flights out of Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports were delayed due to thunderstorms, including an Emirates flight to Houston.The US ban affects nine airlines from eight countries: Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Britain has also announced a parallel ban, effective Saturday, targeting all flights out of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Lebanon.Abu Dhabi, home to UAE national carrier Etihad Airways, is one of the few international airports with a US Customs and Border Protection Facility, which processes immigration and customs inspections before departure.""All Etihad Airways guests travelling to the United States clear US Immigration and Customs at the US Preclearance facility in Terminal 3, the only one of its kind in the Middle East,"" read a statement emailed to AFP.""When guests land in the US, they arrive as domestic passengers with no requirement to queue for immigration checks again.""The bans have come under criticism for targeting majority-Muslim countries.

business,Investment inflows spur Pakistans corporate sukuk mar,"strong>Growth of sharia-compliant investment funds in Pakistan is helping fuel demand for sukuk, or Islamic bonds, giving local firms new funding options while strengthening the case for Islamic pensions in other majority-Muslim countries.</strongStrong demand for Islamic funds, and in turn sukuk, could encourage other countries trying to deepen their Islamic capital markets, in particular in the Gulf region where private pensions are rare.Pakistan's Islamic banks lag their conventional peers, holding around 13 percent of total deposits, while Islamic mutual funds and private pensions have a far greater market share.Islamic mutual funds held 242.7 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) in assets as of December, or 37 percent of the total, official statistics show.Almost two-thirds of assets in the country's voluntary pension system (VPS) are now managed under Islamic principles.All 10 VPS managers offer Islamic pension products, worth a combined 14.5 billion rupees, or 63 percent of total VPS assets with the largest VPS product being sharia-compliant.Attractive yields, tax exemptions and greater flexibility in choosing external managers have made VPS products popular, which in turn adds to demand for sukuk, said Abdullah Ghaffar, head of investment banking at Al Baraka Bank Pakistan.""Mutual funds, both fixed income as well as equity funds, have become big time investors in existing and new sukuk issues taking place because of the huge assets under management under their disposal.""Two recent sukuk transactions from manufacturing companies attracted significant interest from such investment funds, while equity funds are also becoming active in initial public offerings, Ghaffar added.Reforms from Pakistan's capital market regulator have also helped equity-like financing vehicles, known as modarabas, to grow their combined assets above 41 billion rupees.INCENTIVESIslamic funds screen their portfolios according to religious guidelines such as bans on tobacco, alcohol and gambling, similar to socially responsible funds in Western markets.They must also adhere to Islam's ban on interest payments, which confines them to sukuk for their fixed-income investments, a relatively small market where demand has traditionally exceeded supply.Tax changes have also helped sukuk issuance. In September, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue granted sukuk similar tax treatment to conventional bonds.This has attracted a wide range of issuers: Byco Oil Pakistan Limited raised 3.12 billion rupees via sukuk using a credit gurantee and Ghani Gases raised 1.3 billion rupees via a privately-placed sukuk last month.In December, Fatima Fertilizer Company mandated banks to raise 10.5 billion rupees through a lease-based sukuk.Pakistan GasPort Consortium Limited plans to raise 8.6 billion rupees via seven-year sukuk to finance the construction of the country's second LNG import terminal.",3/2/2017,,

The Joint Ministerial Commission provides the best platform to take stock of bilateral cooperation in various economic sectors and setting new benchmarks to carry this cooperation forward.Referring to the level of bilateral trade between the two countries, the prime minister reiterated that this needed to be further enhanced to its fullest potential. Encouraging greater private sector interaction could enhance the existing level of trade as well as bridge the imbalance in existing trade patterns.Nawaz Sharif said over 114,000 Pakistanis live in Kuwait which was evidence of the strong ties existing between the two countries. It also confirmed the immense importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Kuwait.Nawaz Sharif also emphasized the importance of early resumption of GCC- Pakistan Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the support of Kuwait and most importantly spoke of the need for lifting of visa restrictions as it would remove a major hurdle in freedom of movement for the business community.He stressed that Pakistan was an investment friendly country and an attractive destination for foreign investors, due to its liberal investment policy and high rate of return.There are ample opportunities for investors, with one hundred percent equity or joint ventures in Pakistan. Over 1,000 leading multinational companies are currently successfully operating in various sectors of our economy.The Prime Minister said there were a number of energy and infrastructure development projects in Pakistan that could be considered by foreign investors. He said we would welcome further investments from Kuwait in mega infrastructure and energy projects being undertaken in Pakistan.Earlier, Nawaz Sharif was accorded a warm welcome upon arrival at the Bayan Palace with Guard of Honor.Meanwhile, talking to Speaker of Kuwaiti Parliament Marzouq Al-Ghanim in Kuwait City, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for greater parliamentary exchanges between Pakistan and Kuwait.He said these exchanges will enhance relations between the two countries.Speaker Marzouq briefed the Prime Minister about the proceeding of Kuwaiti Parliament.",3/7/2017,,

The B&amp;R initiative is a vital combination of geo-economics and geo-strategy.The Belt and Road (B&amp;R) is an innovative paradigm of global integration involving 65 countries, including one-third of the world�s GDP, impacting 65 percent of the world�s population and a quarter of all the goods and services, the website observed.Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in late 2013. It comprises the �Belt,� which is a network of roads across the world, and �the Road� which is actually a network of shipping lanes and ports.The project has a geo-strategic component focused on advancing China�s economic goals and utilizing its industrial potential. It serves to remove China�s dependence on the Malacca Strait for oil imports, improves trade connectivity, furthers China�s foreign policy and minimizes conflicts as it reconnects the world.This project of the century has kept the world economy afloat since 2013 by withstanding the crash of the trans-Atlantic banking systems.As PricewaterhouseCoopers reports, the �real value� in China�s economy and its investments in countries along its Belt and Road initiative is shifting to infrastructure projects and rising at a rapid pace.The B&amp;R is to be financed mainly by the Silk Road Fund and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Additionally, the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership provides Beijing with the perfect opportunity to re-integrate Asian investment that used to find its way to American banks.Further prospects and direction of the B&amp;R initiative will be determined at the �two sessions� as the project is an integral part of China�s new reforms and an intrinsic part of its foreign policy.China is going to hold the Belt and Road forum this May and it would be a masterstroke by China if more countries like U.S. and India announce their participation or signal their approval with their presence at this forum; the great game is never really over and there is much more scope in Chinese wisdom and peaceful globalization in the Eurasian Century.",3/7/2017,,

Xinjiang was once a key transportation and trade hub on the ancient Silk Road.During this year's annual session of the National People's Congress, the Xinjiang delegation proposed the construction of high-speed railways linking the regional capital of Urumqi and southern Xinjiang's Kashgar, the starting point of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as well as another one connecting Urumqi and northern Xinjiang's Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border.The delegation also proposed starting construction on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which has long been discussed and planned. The national lawmakers from Xinjiang believe it is urgent to start construction on the railway to enhance economic cooperation with the two Central Asian countries.A total of 223 westbound trains carrying construction materials, agricultural produce, garments and other merchandise traveled via nine cross-border routes linking Xinjiang to Central Asian countries in 2016, said Hu Kaijiang, director of the Xinjiang Economic and Information Commission.This year, Xinjiang plans to expand operations to run 400 westbound cross-border trains to facilitate exports of technology and equipment and seek new growth opportunities, Hu said.Geographic location, rich natural resources and preferential policies introduced to encourage opening-up have given Xinjiang advantages in becoming the core area on the economic belt, Shokrat said. Becoming a key player on the economic belt will also benefit the region's social development.Besides improving its transportation network, the region will focus on the development of key cities along the economic belt. Xinjiang aims to achieve more than 7 percent economic growth this year and to see ""substantial"" progress in making the region serve as the transportation, logistic, financial, cultural and medical center on the modern Silk Road, he added.",3/17/2017,,

business,For Turkish giant Arcelik Pakistan is among focus ar,"strong>LONDON: Arcelik, the home appliances arm of Turkey's biggest industrial conglomerate Koc Holding, is working on acquisitions to speed up its international expansion, particularly in Asia, its chief executive said on Monday.</strongThe company, which sells washing machines, dryers and refrigerators under labels including Beko and Grundig, wants more such ""white goods"" brands, but could also look at small appliances such as coffee makers and food processors.""(M&amp;A) is important because we have global ambitions,"" CEO Hakan Bulgurlu told Reuters in an interview in London.He forecast ""significant demand growth"" in southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as Bangladesh, Pakistan and India.""They're all focus areas for us,"" he said.Geography is a much more important factor than price, Bulgurlu added. Arcelik could easily do another deal like last year's roughly $250 million purchase of Pakistan's Dawlance, but could also do something several times bigger, he said.""We're opportunistic. We're not restricted on size in any way.""Bulgurlu said international markets should account for 65 percent of Arcelik's sales this year, up from 60 percent in 2016, reaching 80 percent in a few years.Europe currently accounts for the large majority of international sales, though the company has a growing presence in Africa through its 2011 purchase of South Africa's Defy Appliances.GLOBAL UNCERTAINTYBulgurlu stood by Arcelik's forecast for revenue to grow 20 percent this year from 16.10 billion Turkish lira ($4.43 billion) in 2016, even though its overall home market could grow faster than the 3 percent it had previously forecast.The stronger market in Turkey is due to a recent government move to reduce a tax on white goods in order to spur demand. Still, the weak lira has made raw materials such as oil, steel and plastic more expensive, impacting profitability.""There's a lot of uncertainty in the world,"" Bulgurlu said, also citing the weak pound that has caused inflationary pressure in Britain, which accounts for 10 percent of sales.The company had to raise prices on some UK products and expects that to temper demand, especially after there was a surge due to expectations of future price rises.""I think demand will taper off a little,"" Bulgurlu said, noting however that Arcelik still aimed to double its business in Britain in the next five years, even as the country's exit from the European Union raises questions about the economy and the future of foreign workers.""It will continue to be our most important market outside Turkey,"" he said.Arcelik opened a research and development center in Cambridge, eastern England, last year, in an effort to take advantage of a British tradition for scientific innovation.""We want to tap into that and take that pure research and make it applicable to appliances,"" Bulgurlu said, citing potential for smart appliances such as refrigerators that know when food is going bad and ovens that can keep food cool until its time to cook.",3/21/2017,,
business,Saudis to tighten curbs on foreign workers in local jobs pu,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said. It is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 3, one source said, declining to be named because an official announcement has not yet been made.",3/21/2017,,

They will be paired with SEPTA's new electric locomotives, which are being built by Siemens of Germany.<br/>The multilevel coaches will be produced primarily at CRRC MA's main US manufacturing facility in Springfield, Massachusetts.It is the latest win for CRRC.
