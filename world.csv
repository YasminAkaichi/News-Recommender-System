"(TAP) - Venezuelan security forces used teargas on Tuesday to stop protesters led by U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido from marching on the national legislature, which pro-government lawmakers seized control of in January.The march, attended by several thousand opposition demonstrators, advanced only a few blocks towards the congress in downtown Caracas before a phalanx of riot police barricaded the road and began firing teargas to disperse the crowd.""It once again demonstrates the totalitarian nature of this regime,"" said lawmaker and Guaido supporter Williams Davila, his face and eyes red from the teargas.Opposition legislators later held a extramural session in the fashionable Las Mercedes district nearby, setting up chairs on the neighborhood's main avenue and hanging a large Venezuelan flag as a backdrop.""We are a powerful majority that can change this country,"" said Guaido during the session. ""The dictatorship thinks it can take us on, that it can keep us quiet.""Guaido for weeks had urged Venezuelans to join the march as a way of reviving street protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who Washington has sought to oust through economic sanctions. The protests surged in 2019 but have waned as the ruling Socialist Party has clung to power.Tuesday's march was the opposition's first since Guaido returned on Feb. 11 from a diplomatic tour that included a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. It marked another test of Guaido's capacity to mobilize supporters, who are increasingly weary with his inability to oust Maduro despite a broad U.S. sanctions program and Venezuela's long-running economic crisis.After the rally, officers from an elite Venezuelan police unit, the Special Action Force, raided a hotel in Caracas and detained three opposition lawmakers staying there, congress said on its Twitter account. Two of the lawmakers were released later that evening, while they said the other remained detained.One of the released lawmakers, Zandra Castilla, told reporters outside the hotel that officers threatened them, confiscated their phones and told them ""here you can't speak bad about Maduro.""Venezuela's Information Ministry did not return a request to comment.Maduro's government held its own separate rallies in downtown Caracas on Tuesday that were attended by hundreds of red-shirted supporters.A group of legislators backed by the Socialist Party installed themselves as leaders of congress in January after troops blocked Guaido from attending a session in which he was expected to be elected to a second term as assembly head.Opposition lawmakers later re-elected Guaido, but they have been largely unable to meet at the legislative palace, once home to the only branch of government beyond Maduro's control.More than 50 countries last year recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president following Maduro's disputed 2018 re-election, which was widely dismissed as fraudulent.Venezuela this year is slated to hold parliamentary elections, but the opposition has not determined if it will participate due to concerns over free and fair conditions.

"(TAP) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is preparing to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners in coming days, according to a decree viewed by Reuters on Tuesday, as the United Nations backed a U.S.-led push to end Afghanistan's 18-year war.The two-page decree signed by Ghani, which requires all released Taliban prisoners to provide ""a written guarantee to not return to the battlefield"", is aimed at paving the way for direct talks with the hardline insurgent group.The United States warned the Taliban that the current high level of violence was ""not conducive to advancing the peace process"" after the 15-member U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution.The United States signed an agreement with the Taliban last month for a phased withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces if the Taliban keeps its commitments. It also prescribed the start of talks between the insurgents and an Afghan government delegation on a political settlement to end decades of conflict.The prisoner release decree, which is expected to be made public later by Ghani's office, said the process will begin in four days.""The process of releasing 1,500 Taliban prisoners will be completed within 15 days, with 100 prisoners walking out of Afghan jails every day,"" it said.The decree said talks between the government and the Taliban will run parallel with the prisoner release, and requires the insurgents to stick to commitments to a reduction in violence.Taliban commanders have sent vehicles to be ready to collect the the prisoners and said they will honour the deal by handing over 1,000 government troops.Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Cherith Norman Chalet said the Taliban had taken steps to stop attacks in cities and against major bases.""But more needs to be done and we urge them to also reduce violence against Afghan forces in the countryside to give intra-Afghan negotiations and peace the opportunity to succeed,"" she said.The peace process has been complicated by differing wording of documents drafted in separate meetings between the United States and the Taliban, and the United States and the Afghan government.Earlier on Tuesday, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared to take a swipe at the U.S. deal with the Taliban, saying: ""It is difficult to have an agreement when you leave out the government of the country that you are expecting to uphold and live under that agreement.""Speaking at a U.N. event on Afghan women's rights, Clinton also stressed the need for women to be at the negotiating table.""Afghan women today are rightly afraid... that the gains they have made with all of our help will be washed away in a rush to achieve a peace that will not hold anyway,"" she said. ""This is not just morally wrong, this is dangerous.""The Security Council resolution emphasized the importance of including women, youth and minorities and ensuring any political settlement protects their rights.","11/03/2020 10:02, Kabul/Afghanistan",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-World/12424463-afghan-govt-to,Afghan govt to release Taliban prisoners as UN backs push to end war,World,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

"(TAP) - Latin American women stayed away from offices, schools and government offices on Monday to join a second day of marches to protest against gender violence, inequality and restricted rights.Monday's wildcat strike, dubbed ""a day without us,"" is intended to show what life would be like if women vanished from society. It followed a series of massive protests on Sunday to mark International Women's Day.In the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez, just across the U.S. border, factories stood unusually quiet as many women stayed home.The work stoppages in Mexico also included indigenous Zapatista women in the south and numerous office workers in the capital. Paola Rojas, a female columnist for major daily El Universal, left her space in the newspaper completely blank expect for a hashtag supporting the protest.In Chile, women wearing medical uniforms, industrial overalls and school uniforms joined a march down a central thoroughfare of Santiago, the capital, to congregate outside President Sebastian Pinera's downtown office.The Mexican capital's usually traffic-choked streets were virtually empty at rush hour on Monday. Public transport was mostly devoid of women, schools were closed and many workplaces were empty.Molotov cocktails were thrown at the doors of the national palace and women clashed outside its main cathedral with male anti-abortion protesters, some with shaved heads and making Nazi salutes.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had said government employees were free to join the walkout.According to a poll published late last week by newspaper El Financiero, 67% of Mexicans surveyed said they supported the stoppage, while 57% of women said they planned to join.Some Mexican women chose to turn up for their jobs, saying work was its own kind of protest, with others saying they could not afford to miss a day.Organisers of Sunday's march in Santiago estimated two million people took part, compared with a police estimate of 150,000, and there were sporadic clashes between marchers and police.

"(TAP) - A group of women outside Mexico City's main cathedral clashed on Sunday with men protesting abortion who made Nazi salutes, among scuffles that left dozens injured during a protest of tens of thousands of people on International Women's Day.The incidents reflected an undercurrent of anger throughout the day, in which the city government said 80,000 people marched through Mexico City's historic core to the public square fronting the cathedral and National Palace.Wearing green bandanas symbolizing support for abortion rights, at least a dozen women ripped down banners describing abortion as femicide and set them on fire.The male anti-abortion proponents, some of whom had shaved heads and one of whom carried a whip, yelled vulgar slang in return. Mexico has a small ultra-nationalist movement that shares ideology with global hard-right groups.Elsewhere in the city center, women in black masks and armed with hammers smashed the windshield of a car, overturned a van and burnt doors of buildings.Despite many protesters urging against violence, city authorities said the day's clashes left 65 people with injuries, including burns but none life threatening.Activists said they attended to show outrage over a wave of femicides in Mexico, which have risen 137% over the past five years.At the doors to the National Palace where the president lives, activists tossed Molotov cocktails over a contingent of policewomen in riot gear who were among nearly 3,000 female officers deployed during the march.One of the homemade bombs burst amid a cluster of protesters, setting the pants of a female photographer from newspaper El Universal on fire. The newspaper said she was hospitalized with second-degree burns.Along the palace walls, graffitied slogans rebuked the government, including, ""the president doesn't care about us"" and ""misogynist AMLO,"" referring to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.Activists also used hammers to tear down a metal barrier surrounding the Bank of Mexico, and lit a bonfire whose flames and smoke could be seen blocks away from the public square.Amid the flashpoints, protesters sang the anti-femicide anthem ""Song Without Fear"" and young women performed a lyrical dance that moved some observers to tears.","09/03/2020 08:53, Mexico City/Mexico",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-World/12415425-nazi-salutes,"Nazi salutes, Molotov cocktails rock massive Mexico women's march",World,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

"(TAP) - Women’s rights have made significant progress in recent decades, from the abolition of discriminatory laws to increased numbers of girls in school; But we now face a powerful pushback, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in his message on International Women's Day.Legal protections against rape and domestic abuse are being diluted in some countries; women’s sexual and reproductive rights are under threat, he added.All this is because gender equality is fundamentally a question of power. Centuries of discrimination and deep-rooted patriarchy have created a yawning gender power gap in our economies, our political systems, our corporations and our culture.""This profoundly affects us all and is a barrier to solving many of the challenges and threats we face, from achieving a fair globalization that works for everyone, to ending the epidemic of violence against women and building peaceful and secure societies. We must also urgently address the digital gender divide that threatens to entrench gender inequality in societies and economies for decades to come,"" Guterres pointed out.With women still occupying just one quarter of seats in parliaments around the world, political representation is the clearest evidence of the gender power gap, said the UN S-G. Going forward, I will do everything in my power to make sure women are represented in all decision-making at the United Nations, including in peace processes, he added.""I will also advocate with Member States for the repealing of all discriminatory laws, for women’s equal participation in all spheres, for increased protection from violence, and for more inclusive economies,"" the UN Chief stressed.Gender equality is a means of redefining and transforming power that will yield benefits for all.

"(TAP) - World food prices slipped in February, ending four months of successive increases, with the spread of coronavirus dampening demand for some products, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 180.5 points last month, down 1.0% on January.FAO also slightly upped its forecast for cereal production, predicting a crop totalling some 2.719 billion tonnes in 2019, up from a previous forecast of 2.715 billion and some 2.3% higher than the 2018 crop.The vegetable oil price index plunged 10.3% from January, led by a slump in palm oil prices, while the cereal price index eased 0.9%, with the international prices of all major cereals, except rice, declining.FAO said the spread of the coronavirus contributed to the price decline in both indices amid fears the outbreak would trigger a global slowdown.Coronavirus also hit the meat price index, which dropped 2% on the month as imports declined to China, the epicentre of the outbreak, which has so far infected at least 95,300 people globally and caused more than 3,200 deaths.The dairy price index rose 4.6%, pushed higher by a rise for cheese, fuelled by tightening export supplies from New Zealand and Australia.However, quotations for milk powder fell due to a slowdown in purchases by China, the world's largest importer, because of delays in cargo handling in ports, affected by the spread of the coronavirus, FAO said.By contrast, the sugar price index rose 4.5% on the month, hitting its highest level since May, 2017, mostly caused by prospects of lower production in India and protracted drought in Thailand -- two major sugar producing countries.FAO also issued a new forecast for world cereal production, saying global cereal markets were expected to remain well supplied, comfortably covering a forecast growth in consumption.Its preliminary forecast for 2020 wheat production was pegged at 763 million tonnes, almost unchanged from the near-record level registered in 2019.
