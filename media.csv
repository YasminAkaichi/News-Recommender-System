Media,TAP begins digitisation of its 1.5 million film archives,"(TAP)– The project of digitising film archives of Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) news agency, around 1.5 million film negatives, was officially launched on Friday at the agency's headquarters in Tunis.Photographers, journalists, technicians, marketing and sales teams attended the celebration ceremony of this large-scale project carried out with the support of the Media Support Programme in Tunisia (PAMT) managed by African Centre for Training Journalists and Communicators (CAPJC). The launch of this project, designed by European and Tunisian experts, was marked by the presence of TAP acting CEO, the director of the photo desk, the training director and all the teams involved. The digitisation started with photos dating from the 59s with more than 60 thousand photos, which will be scanned in a first step, said TAP photos desk director Lassaad Safer.The photos will be put to use by the editorial staff and marketed to potential customers. The primary objective is to “save, digitise and enhance the photos and make them available to customers through adequate human and technical resources,” he said.Trainer within the PAMT programme Renaud Girard arrived “to support TAP in the digitisation of film archives.” He mentioned that a huge number of photos would be facing destruction if not immediately exploited. It is a long-term project which will take “almost ten years” to complete. The next steps should involve the establishment of a large system of human resources and equipment to finalise the programme.Director of external relations at TAP Chaouki Aloui stressed the importance of providing necessary human resources to the development of this project.”He also mentioned the audiovisual studio within the agency which is now “technically operational.” However, in terms of human resources, this studio requires “a team of photographers and journalists that are well trained for its effective exploitation.”CAPJC director Saïd Ben Kraïem recalled the different forms of partnership between CAPJC and TAP as well as training provided to TAP agents, including journalists, photographers and technicians. At the end of the first phase of the PAMT programme, he announced that a second phase will start in May.TAP archives date from the 1940s and include photos that belonged to the State Secretariat for Information, during the colonial period and then with the independence under the Bourguiba regime. With the creation of the Agency, a large part of this photographic treasure, composed mainly of political news, was recovered by TAP to keep it in its archives.In addition to photos, TAP has archives in the documentation order which houses dispatches published since its creation in 1960 until the start of the digital age.","31/01/2020 18:19, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Culture-and-Media/12279863-tap-begins,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

Her death in the prime of life marks the end of a young woman's journey as a fighter. The ministry regrets the loss of ""the champion of free speech, the activist, the blogger and the academic"". It looked back on the career of a young woman who was ""very active in the fight against Internet censorship and the defence of freedom of expression.""Tunisia has lost a free voice and an exceptional personality who left a mark during the last decade of dictatorship and the whole period that followed,"" the SNJT text reads. The Union took stock of ""its relentless struggle for the rights of Tunisians to freedom of expression, thought and access to information as well as individual and collective freedoms.""It recalled the continuous harassment and physical and moral attacks to which it was subjected under the dictatorship, a situation that continued even after the revolution with death threats that made it necessary to provide her with close protection"".""She was subjected to denigration and defamation campaigns affecting her person and her dignity, because of her opinions about a certain societal model and her support for gender equality"", it is also stated.Born on May 22, 1983, the late Lina Ben M’henni held the position of Assistant Lecturer in English language the University of Tunis. After university studies in Tunisia, Lina Ben M'henni continued her studies in the United States of America, thanks to a Fullbright scholarship. During her studies in the USA (2008-2009), she taught Arabic at Tufts University, near Boston.    With the beginnings of the Tunisian revolution, she gained the image of an activist in the revolutionary youth movement through her writings as well as her presence in the streets.She gained international notoriety through her blog ""Tunisian Girl"" in which she freely expressed herself on political and social affairs in the country. She made herself known through her writings against the dictatorship under Ben Ali.In 2011, she published her first book ""Tunisian girl, blogger for an Arab spring"".  Her commitment has earned her several medals in various countries around the world. In May 2011, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 2011.Lina M'henni was several times at the top of the ranking of the best female bloggers in the world. She was granted the Best Blog Award 2011 at the seventh edition of the major international blog competition, BOB's, organised by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Bonn. She was also ranked 23rd in the prestigious ""Arabian Business"" magazine's ranking of the 100 most influential women for 2012. The deceased's commitment was fuelled by a favourable family background as her father Sadok Ben Mhenni was a left-wing activist and one of the founders of the Tunisian section of Amnesty International. Her interest in reading led to the idea of the campaign to collect books for Tunisian prisons, which she launched on the sidelines of the Carthage Film Days (CFFD) 2019. This action then enabled her to collect 45 thousand copies with a view to making them available to people in prisons.
