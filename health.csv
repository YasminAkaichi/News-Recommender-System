Health,12 Fraught Hours With E.M.T.s in a City Under Siege,"PATERSON, N.J. — “Back up, sir!” shouted Kenny Kiefer, a Fire Department battalion chief, his N95 mask muffling his words.Could he be infected with the coronavirus? Possibly. But he was neither wheezing nor gulping for breath. The chief explained to the man that he could become far sicker by being in the hospital.Day and night, ambulances crisscross the streets of Paterson, the eerie silence of a once-raucous city shredded by siren shrieks so pervasive it sounds as if the city is under attack.Which, in a sense, it is.Deputy Chief John Bradle, 56, a brisk, bald 24-year veteran of the department, issued the day’s orders. Accustomed to sharing a cramped firehouse bunkroom, the men listened in a huddle, then suddenly shifted apart, awkwardly remembering to social distance. (The Paterson Fire Department oversees emergency medical services; nearly all 275 firefighters are certified as E.M.T.s.)The rules: One guy sits in the back, always in a full hazmat suit. A second rides up front, and gets out only if needed to help the first one with a stair evacuation chair or stretcher. The driver must remain in the cab so that it stays uncontaminated. He may step out for one reason only: to seal the second E.M.T. in full hazmat.“We’re not openly discouraging them from going to the hospital,” he said, “but we’re informing them that if they don’t have an escalating fever, the E.R. will send you right back home.”Here, it was immediately apparent from the patient’s frantic adult daughter that this case was critical.The ambulance driver leapt out of the cab to suit up his buddy. Neighbors leaning over rowhouse staircase railings watched as two men in shiny beige hazmat suits, safety goggles, a mask with disposable bubblegum-pink filtration disks, eggplant-purple gloves and knee-high green chemical-resistant boots with lemon-yellow soles, headed into an apartment building.A new call was coming in: Another ambulance, freshly deconned, sped off.More recently, he has been sharing supplies with police and shelter workers, and just gave 1,000 N95 masks, 15,000 surgical masks plus thermometers and disposable stethoscopes to St. Joe’s.Usually a warming spring breeze and a bright blue afternoon sky will bring out the best in the city. But now, as ambulances bust through red lights, giving wild chase to the coronavirus, even the sight of two people fist-bumping at a street corner seemed tinged with menace.The next call came in: person not breathing. Capt. Chris Huber sped to the address, on a narrow street crammed tight with paint-peeling apartment houses, to direct E.M.T.s and hospital paramedics.After a hard call while being encapsulated in hazmat, guys often get sweat-drenched and even claustrophobic. Earlier in the day, one of them pleaded with his supervisor, “Hey, I need a break! I’m going crazy in this thing.”Even so, the numbers are harsh. So far, 81 members of the department have been affected: 30 are sick; 51 more have been quarantined. They include deputy and battalion chiefs, captains, firefighter E.M.T.s and dispatchers.In the break room, the TV remote is jammed. The guys handed it around, smacking, shaking, rattling it.The woman, worn, red-eyed, wrapped in a scarf, her hair wild, appeared in the doorway. She was miserable-sick but not coughing.Meanwhile, the new E.M.T. shift was just getting started. Three-man crews huddled in the decon tent, learning the new protocols.","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-emt-workers.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/science/00VIRUS-EMTS-patient/merlin_171015786_b0a55abc-4367-40c1-866f-278e80fb3287-jumbo.jpg
Health,F.D.A. Approves First Coronavirus Antibody Test in U.S.,"The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a new test for coronavirus antibodies, the first for use in the United States.Antibody testing eventually should give scientists a better sense of how widespread the infection is in the population — and help researchers calculate more precisely the death rate.The new test looks only for the presence of the antibodies and delivers a qualitative yes or no answer — it does not say how well any antibodies are working, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. ","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/health/coronavirus-antibody-test.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/science/02VIRUS-ANTIBODY-TEST1/02VIRUS-ANTIBODY-TEST1-videoLarge.jpg
Health,Trump Administration Officials Weigh How Far to Go on Recommending Masks,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is close to recommending that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public, a change in position that reflects new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms and new data suggesting the United States is not yet slowing the rate of infections.“The eyes are not in the mask. If you are touching things and touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way,” Dr. Birx said. “This will be an additive piece if it comes out, rather than saying it is a substitute for it. It is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out.”Her caveats on masks reflect what has been a common view among many public health bodies about the effectiveness of masks for the general public. Until now, the C.D.C., like the World Health Organization, has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason has been to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.But earlier this week, Mr. Trump said that broad use of nonmedical masks, at least, was “certainly something we could discuss.”","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/health/masks-coronavirus-cdc.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/science/01VIRUS-MASKS/01VIRUS-MASKS-videoLarge.jpg
Health,Unproven Stem Cell Therapy Gets OK for Testing in Coronavirus Patients,"An experimental stem cell therapy derived from human placentas will begin early testing in patients with the coronavirus, a New Jersey biotech company said Thursday.In recent weeks, the established scientific process of evaluating a drug’s safety and effectiveness has been upended by Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly promoted the potential of two long-used malaria drugs that have shown mainly anecdotal evidence of helping patients. On Saturday, the F.D.A. took the unusual step of approving those drugs to treat hospitalized patients with coronavirus on an emergency basis, even though no significant clinical trials have yet been done.At least one outside expert said the approach could present safety risks. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell researcher at the University of California, Davis, said that patients with coronavirus can develop severe reactions where their immune systems go too far in attacking cells in their lungs, causing damaging inflammation. Other cell therapies tested in China are designed to dampen the immune response. He said one risk with the natural killer cells is they could go in the other direction, exacerbating respiratory problems “by massive killing of the patients’ respiratory cells.”","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/health/stem-cell-treatment-coronavirus.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/science/02VIRUS-stemcell/02VIRUS-stemcell-videoLarge.jpg
Health,Essential Drug Supplies for Virus Patients Are Running Low,"Across the country, as hospitals confront a harrowing surge in coronavirus cases, they are also beginning to report shortages of critical medications — especially those desperately needed to ease the disease’s assault on patients’ respiratory systems.At the same time, the rate at which these prescriptions are filled and shipped to hospitals has dropped considerably, down by half to more than three-fourths in the last month, according to data collected by Premier Inc., a health care improvement company that provides group purchasing, analytics, consulting and various services to more than 4,000 hospitals and approximately 175,000 other providers in the United States.Hospitals in particular are feeling the pinch in supplies. In a recent survey of 377 hospitals and 100 long-term care, home infusion and retail pharmacies, Premier found that drug shortages were pervasive in acute care settings, where 70 percent of respondents reported at least one shortage for coronavirus drugs. Among long-term care facilities, home care settings and retail pharmacies, 48 percent reported shortages.Doctors at several hospitals have been using a combination of midazolam, hydromorphone and ketamine. Under normal circumstances, they would use propofol and fentanyl because they are short-acting, the doctor said. The others have a longer duration and that makes it harder for patients to emerge from sedation later.“So, politics is beginning to lay into the supply chain issues,” Mr. Schondelmeyer said.Increasing production is also dependent on quotas for controlled substances and ingredients that are set by the Drug Enforcement Administration. On Tuesday, the American Hospital Association and four other medical groups sent a letter requesting that the D.E.A. temporarily increase quotas to add flexibility for domestic manufacturing, but the agency has not done so yet, Ms. Fox said.“In general, that’s good advice up front,” Mr. Schondelmeyer said. “But with drugs like albuterol, we’re not going to be able to sustain that because we’re already on short supply.”Transparency in the available supply chain data could help prevent drug shortages in the future. Pharmaceutical companies, wholesalers and suppliers typically know where the raw materials for drugs are sourced and which countries manufacture which parts of a drug, as well as which factories could take over if production needs to be scaled up. But each company keeps this data confidential, and even the F.D.A. does not have a systematic way to look across drug production and supply chain capabilities.","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/health/coronavirus-drug-shortages.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/science/02VIRUS-SHORTAGES1/02VIRUS-SHORTAGES1-videoLarge.jpg
Health,Some Coronavirus Patients Show Signs of Brain Ailments,"Neurologists around the world say that a small subset of patients with Covid-19 are developing serious impairments of the brain.On Tuesday, doctors in Detroit reported another disturbing case involving a female airline worker in her late 50s with Covid-19. She was confused, and complained of a headache; she could tell the physicians her name but little else, and became less responsive over time. Brain scans showed abnormal swelling and inflammation in several regions, with smaller areas where some cells had died.Much is still unknown about the neurological symptoms, but efforts are underway to study the phenomena, said Dr. Sherry H-Y. Chou, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who is leading a team of investigators for the Neurocritical Care Society.“We are still in the early days of this, and we don’t really know for sure.”Neurologists in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started, were among the first to report the symptoms in a preliminary paper published online in February.For potential Covid-19 patients and the people caring for them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes “new confusion or inability to rouse” among the warning signs that should prompt a decision to seek immediate medical care.","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-stroke-seizures-confusion.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/science/01VIRUS-MENTAL1/01VIRUS-MENTAL1-videoLarge.jpg

Health,The Coronavirus Patients Betrayed by Their Own Immune Systems,"The 42-year-old man arrived at a hospital in Paris on March 17 with a fever, cough and the “ground glass opacities” in both lungs that are a trademark of infection with the new coronavirus.But in some cases — as much as 15 percent of people battling any serious infection, according to Dr. Cron’s team — the immune system keeps raging long after the virus is no longer a threat. It continues to release cytokines that keep the body on an exhausting full alert. In their misguided bid to keep the body safe, these cytokines attack multiple organs including the lungs and liver, and may eventually lead to death.On March 5, China approved the drug to treat serious cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and authorized clinical trials. On March 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to the pharmaceutical company Roche to test the drug in hundreds of people with coronavirus infection.A patient battling a cytokine storm may have an abnormally fast heart rate, fever and a drop in blood pressure. Apart from a surge in interleukin-6, the body may also show high swirling levels of molecules called interleukin-1, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Doctors could also turn to corticosteroids, which broadly turn down the entire immune response. That poses its own danger, by exposing the patient to other opportunistic infections, especially in a hospital. “It’s about getting the balance right between suppression of the over-exuberant immune response and still allowing the immune response to fight the virus,” Dr. Manson said.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/science/01VIRUS-CYTOKINESTORM1/01VIRUS-CYTOKINESTORM1-videoLarge.jpg
Health,"Zantac Products Should Not Be Sold or Used, F.D.A. Warns, Citing Cancer Danger","The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday asked companies to stop selling all forms of the heartburn drug Zantac, after concluding that a potential cancer-causing contaminant can build up in the drug when stored for long periods.In a statement, Sanofi, the manufacturer of the brand-name version of Zantac, said that it recalled the product in October, and that all retailers and consumers were previously instructed to return or destroy the product.At the time of its testing, Valisure speculated that the source of the contaminant was the result of the “inherent instability” of the ranitidine molecule, which can degrade under certain conditions, such as high temperatures, to create NDMA.","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/health/zantac-cancer-fda.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/science/01ZANTAC/01ZANTAC-videoLarge.jpg
