Economy,TABC urges authorities to save SMEs from coronavirus spread ,"(TAP)-Facing the spread of the coronavirus, the Tunisia-Africa Business Council (TABC) proposed on Monday to the authorities and banks a battery of measures to protect Tunisian enterprises and save them from an unprecedented debacle.Among the proposed measures; the rescheduling of debt and credit repayment deadlines with two to three months of non-application of interest, the opening of the tap of management credits and short-term loans to support the treasuries of Tunisian SMEs, the facilitation of investment credits and the reduction of the granting deadlines as well as the reduction of the key rate of the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) by at least 200 basis points. The Council also proposes to support the Tunisian dinar to remain at its current level against the dollar and the euro, to put in payment without delay the outstanding debts of enterprises to public administrations and public enterprises, to make a moratorium in favour of small and medium enterprises in terms of tax and social charges, to reduce the tax and social charges of SMEs, which constitute 95% of the economic fabric. The TABC also recommends reintroducing tax relief for productive investment, suspending the application of VAT on sales by property developers, and setting up a credit line for enterprises in serious difficulty. According to the TABC press release, the State may possibly consider offering guarantees to banks so that they can work to save and finance SMEs, to take on some of the employees who are technically unemployed in order to preserve as many jobs as possible, and to create a fund to help enterprises in suspension of payments or in serious difficulty. Besides, the council pointed out the need to facilitate procedures and deadlines for the export of Tunisian products, to launch a major program of digitalisation of the administration and education, as well as Tele-work, to set up a Task Force composed of the best public and private competences to come out with a rescue program and ensure its implementation.In addition, the TABC called for national and international solidarity among individuals of the same nation and among peoples of different nations to overcome this health and economic crisis.

Economy,Crisis Unit on olive oil problems to convene Friday in Parliament,"(TAP) - The crisis unit on olive oil problems for the 2019/2020 season will meet on Friday afternoon in Parliament. This cell is composed of representatives of the Prime Ministry, the ministers of finance, agriculture, water resources and fisheries, the Tunisian Confederation of Industry and Trade and Handicrafts and the Tunisian Union of Agriculture and Fisheries (UTAP), as well as the director general of the oil office and the president of the parliamentary committee in the areas of agriculture, food security, trade and related services.The decision to set up this monitoring unit followed a hearing on Thursday morning by the Agriculture Committee of UTAP representatives to examine the problems faced by olive harvesting and oil extraction after the collapse of prices due to the abundance of production and the accumulation of financial commitments by oil mill owners and exporting companies to banks.The head of the agriculture committee, Moez Hajj Rehouma (Ennahdha bloc), confirmed Thursday to TAP that the olive oil crisis unit, at the level of production, consumption and distribution at the local market and export levels, will examine how to support the funds intended for the oil office to play its role in coping with the abundant production of olive oil (purchase and storage). The storage capacity of the Office is estimated at 100,000 tonnes of olive oil. It is expected that the production quantities for the 2019/2020 season will reach 350 thousand tonnes, which represents a record production for Tunisia.The oil office has been able to receive 50 million dinars in the form of cash loans (it has so far obtained 15 million dinars) and a guarantee line from the State of 100 million dinars as additional funding to support its purchases for the 2019/20 season. The total financing needs of this regulatory structure are estimated, according to the CEO, Chokri Bayoudh, to be 170 million dinars by mid-January 2020.Bayoudh specified that the possibility of granting subsidies to support storage efforts for the benefit of the private sector is being studied within the framework of a committee at the level of the Central Bank of Tunisia, which includes the ministries concerned, in view of the financial difficulties encountered by the private sector, which limits its marketing and export capacities. According to the same official, this monthly subsidy will be determined and announced shortly.The office is currently seeking to store 30 thousand tonnes of olive oil until mid-January 2020, with six collection centers under the office spread over several regions of the country. The office has been entrusted with the acquisition of all the quantities produced due to the inability of oil mill owners and private individuals to acquire the quantities produced because of the financial difficulties they face. These factors have combined to hamper the progress of the olive harvest season, which is estimated at 25 % to date compared to 40 % during the regular seasons.Tunisia aspires to export 250 thousand tonnes, but it has only managed to export 11, 700 tonnes of olive oil until November 2019 against 20 thousand tonnes in November 2018 due to the late start of the season and the various difficulties encountered by the sector.The financing needs of the olive oil sector are estimated between 600 and 800 million dinars each season, which are the funds provided by the banking sector.The oil office acquires a liter of fine olive oil at 5,600 dinars, and the prices of this product are very much linked to the level of supply and demand locally and on the world market.","26/12/2019 22:04, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Economy/12166954-crisis-unit-on,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

Economy,Tunisian banks are almost absent in Africa (Bassem Loukil),"(TAP) - Tunisian banks are almost absent in Africa, especially in sub-Saharan countries, said president of the Tunisian-African Business Council (TABC), Bassem Loukil, stressing that this hinders the establishment of Tunisian companies in this region of the world.In a statement to TAP, on the sidelines of the launching of the 3rd edition of the international conference ""Financing Investment & Trade in Africa"" (FITA) which is being held from February 4 to 5 in Tunis, Loukil said that only the Société Tunisienne de Banque (STB) is established in Africa. As for the Banque de l'Habitat, he said it only has equity stakes in a few African banks.According to TABC president, the virtual non-existence of Tunisian banks in Africa is due to the lack of a clear legal framework and political vision, specifying that the delay in the adoption of the bill amending the foreign exchange code and the absence of a shipping line between Tunisia and Africa are the main obstacles preventing the establishment of local businesses.  He also said that only the private sector has succeeded in conquering the African market, noting that the number of Tunisian companies in Côte d'Ivoire has increased from 13 to 57 in the last three years. This is also the case of companies established in Senegal, since their number has increased from 3 to 15 companies.Tunisian exports to Africa, he said, have grown from 720 million dinars in 2016 to 3 billion dinars in 2019.  Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT), Marouane Abassi said that the BCT is working to keep pace with the economic dynamics that the African continent is experiencing, through the introduction of measures aimed at easing exchange rate pressures that hamper transfers and financial transactions with the outside world.He also specified that transfers for investments abroad will also be at the heart of the reforms envisaged by the BCT for the period 2020/2021. A liberalisation of guarantees relating to the coverage of management credits granted by foreign banks to subsidiaries of companies resident abroad is also planned.Abassi also mentioned the internationalisation of Tunisian banks ""which has become necessary, even vital, to support economic actors and Tunisian companies, especially exporters, on foreign markets, in this case the African market.He described as modest the presence of Tunisian banks in Africa, despite the presence of STB, BH, Amen Bank and two leasing companies in many African countries.Morocco, Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, he said, were in 2018 the preferred destinations for Tunisian investments in Africa with shares of 48%, 24% and 19% respectively, stressing the importance of strengthening this trend and generalising it to other countries.For his part, Acting Minister of Finance and Development, Investment and International Cooperation, Ridha Chalghoum noted that the African continent is the least economically integrated and that the share of exports between African countries does not exceed 14% against 37% to Europe and 30% to Asia.Chalghoum said that the national companies concentrate their efforts on neighboring countries, especially the Maghreb countries, and this is why the share of Tunisians' exports destined for the African market does not exceed 3% of total exports.The third edition of the International Conference on Investment Finance and Trade in Africa, held on February 4 and 5, 2020, was attended by nearly 4 thousand companies, 35 African countries, 100 financial institutions and 60 renowned speakers.

These areas are in decline today due to pollution, urbanisation, anthropic pressure and the impacts of climate change, he added. According to Boufaroua, Tunisia has 211 natural wetlands, 41 of which are classified as Ramsar site.  He stressed the need to preserve them as they provide several ecosystem benefits to all living species. This includes supplying freshwater, recharging groundwater and mitigating the impacts of climate change.Tunisia has been a member since 1981 of the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty which seeks the preservation and sustainable use of wetlands. In 2018, Ghar El Melh was the first city in North Africa and the Arab world to obtain the Ramsar label.","06/02/2020 19:06, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Economy/12301068-tunisia-and-wwf-to,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

""It is important to take advantage of Tunisia’s geographical position as a country with a strong export capability,"" he said.The PM pointed out that this initiative shows confidence in the country and its active role in Africa, stressing the importance of boosting investment in Tunisia, developing its foreign trade and economic relations, but also strengthening its openness to the world economy, of which the United States is the driving force.He reiterated the high level of cooperation and partnership between Tunisia and the United States and the qualitative leap both countries have made since the revolution when they embraced a new approach of cooperation and dialogue.Chahed spoke of the visit made by former president late Béji Caid Essebssi in 2015, during which a memorandum of understanding was signed on the creation of a strategic partnership. It aimed to reinforce long term bilateral cooperation through the establishment of new cooperation mechanisms, namely the Tunisian-American strategic dialogue and the Joint Economic Commission.He stressed that the simultaneous organisation of this economic event with a regional dimension in Tunisia and the third session of the Tunisian-American Joint Economic Commission, clearly reflects the will of both parties to raise economic cooperation to a level of effective strategic partnership.

Economy,Foreign currency assets reach nearly 20 billion dinars (115 days of import),"(TAP)- Tunisia's foreign currency assets reached nearly 20 billion dinars (19.9 billion dinars on February 11), the equivalent of 115 days of import, according to data published by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) on its website. Foreign currency reserves edged up by 5.4 billion dinars compared to the same period in 2019 (14.4 billion dinars) and covered only 86 days of import.In a document presented last Friday to the House of People's Representatives (HPR), the BCT explained this improvement in reserves by a set of measures taken, including a considerable drop in the volume of foreign currency injected into the money market. The BCT also reduced the demand for dinar loans to finance imports, notably by raising the key interest rate.   The Tunisian foreign exchange assets recorded a considerable decline over the period 2016-2018, covering 45 days of imports. This has raised concerns among local economic operators, foreign investors and even international financial institutions, in addition to international rating agencies, about Tunisia's ability to honour its external financial commitments. Between 2010 and 2017, the country registered an accelerated decline in the foreign exchange reserves, due to a four-fold increase in energy spending and a 50% drop in tourism revenues and a 75% drop in phosphate revenues.According to the BCT data, the Treasury's current account balance stands at 1,447 million dinars (MD), while the volume of notes and coins in circulation amounted to 13,642 MD up to February 10.The overall volume of refinancing reached 11,360 MD up to February 11.","12/02/2020 11:05, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Economy/12319349-foreign-currency,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

This online debate, which will start at 3 p.m., will address several issues including the role of forests, the restoration of forest ecosystems in Tunisia and the involvement of national civil society in their preservation, says WWF Tunisia in a press release issued Thursday.To participate in the conference, simply register on this link, https://docs.google.com/.../1FAIpQLSeWTXxj_FBNKGXhgC.../viewform.../1FAIpQLSeWTXxj_FBNKGXhgC.../viewform, the same source specifies. The Tunisian forest covers an area of 5.6 million ha (including rangelands and estuaries), i.e. 34% of the national territory.  It is home to the majority of the 40 protected areas and 41 Ramsar sites, according to WWF data. Tunisian forests are home to 800,000 to 1 million inhabitants (120,000 households), i.e. 8 to 9% of the total population, with an economic value of forests estimated at 208 MD, i.e. 0.3% of GDP and a total economic value (of forests and rangelands) estimated at more than 612 MD, i.e. nearly 1% of GDP, according to the same source. The Tunisian forests are spread over two main regions: the region of ""Kroumirie"" and ""Mogods"" which constitutes the forest region par excellence of Tunisia. It is the region of the cork oak and the Zen oak with small areas of maritime pine between ""Tabarka"" and the Algerian border.  The second region is that of the High Tell, including the Tunisian Dorsale consisting of several mountains covered with forest vegetation of Aleppo Pine, Holm Oak and Phoenician Juniper. WWF Tunisia points out that the Tunisian forests are subject to various threats which are mainly of anthropic origin (fires, illegal logging, clearing for crops, overgrazing, poaching and urbanisation), adding that these degradations are aggravated by natural phenomena that are making forests increasingly fragile, such as the effects of climate change, rising temperatures and falling rainfall, disease and pest attacks. The General Directorate of Forests (DGF) announced last Sunday the arrest of several individuals accused of felling forest trees and illegal appropriation of state property as well as the seizure of trucks used to secretly transport forest products.

Economy,CONECT says utterly opposed to private sector salaries agreement ,"


(TAP)–The Confederation of Tunisian Citizen Enterprises (French: CONECT) said Wednesday it is utterly opposed to an agreement inked Tuesday by the Minister of Social Affairs, the Secretary General of the Tunisian General Labour Union (French: UGTT) and the President of the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts (Frenc: UTICA).

The agreement provides for private sector employees being paid their full wages in April. The State will 
pay 200 dinars/employee in an exceptional contribution while businesses will pay the rest. 
 CONECT said the agreement was reached without sufficient consultation with the various organisations representing employers. 
  
The confederation said, in this vein, the bulk of the economic fabric is made up of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro businesses that employ more than two million people.  Most of these businesses  had shut down since March 20, i.e. for 26 days, given the general lockdown decreed by the State.
As a result, they do not have sufficient financial resources to bear fixed costs such as rent, social security contributions and tax payments and wages.
 CONECT also urged the government to engage in a serious and open dialogue with all stakeholders to discuss  the best ways to prevent layoffs and the wage crisis.
 It tabled a series of recommendations, mainly suspending urgently April 14 agreement and issuing a decree law after a broad and fair consultation with labour and employers' organisations to remedy the existing shortcomings in the labour legislation and ward off layoffs. 

The organisation also recommended that businesses impose exceptionally taking paid leaves during the confinement. The period will be agreed in consultation with all stakeholders.

Economy,Moody's places Tunisia's B2 rating on review for downgrade,"(TAP) - The Moody's Investors Service has placed on Friday the Government of Tunisia's B2 issuer ratings on review for downgrade. The review period, which may extend beyond the usual three-month horizon, will focus on assessing the authorities' capacity to manage such a significant shock in the context of existing economic, financial and social pressures, and evaluating the options to address the resulting fiscal and external funding gap, Moody's said in a press release issued Friday. According to Moody's, the decision to place the ratings on review for downgrade reflects the acute tightening in global financing conditions that risks precipitating a sustained period of high financing risk, exacerbated further by Tunisia's weakened near-term economic growth prospects, deteriorating fiscal position, and fragile external position. ""For Tunisia, the shock transmits mainly through wider risk premia, a drop in tourism revenue and a sharp slowdown in GDP growth that weaken the sovereign's liquidity and external position and raise its debt burden.  The shock increases the risks to Tunisia's credit profile significantly compared to increasing confidence that macroeconomic stability would be sustained at the time of Moody's change in the outlook on Tunisia's ratings to stable from negative last February,"" the press release reads. Moody's has also placed the Central Bank of Tunisia's B2 senior unsecured rating and the (P)B2 senior unsecured MTN program and senior unsecured shelf ratings on review for downgrade. The Central Bank of Tunisia is legally responsible for the payments on all of the government's bonds. These debt instruments are issued on behalf of the government. The government relies to a large degree on external official funding sources to meet its gross financing needs at about 10-15% of GDP. While negotiations for a follow-up IMF program are underway after the cancellation of the remainder of the previous four-year Extended Fund Facility that started in May 2016, the government has secured a $745 million disbursement under the IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and a $280 million loan from the Islamic Development Bank (Aaa stable) to address the additional fiscal costs of its coronavirus response programme. However, Woody's pointed out that wider fiscal and current account deficits than previously expected due to marked shortfalls in government revenue risks raising Tunisia's financing needs beyond what has been secured so far at a time when financing options are constrained.  According to Moody's, the rating would likely be confirmed at the current B2 level if the review concluded with sufficient confidence that the coronavirus shock will not materially alter Tunisia's debt trajectory and/or erode the recently restored foreign exchange reserve buffer.  Similarly, high confidence in Tunisia's ability to secure funding to meet its upcoming debt service payments in the next few years at affordable costs could also support confirmation of the rating at the current level. Conversely, a downgrade would be likely if there were delays in the availability of or marked increase in the cost of external funding, or a significantly more severe deterioration in Tunisia's fiscal and debt metrics that would weaken Tunisia's fiscal strength and foreign exchange reserves adequacy, the statement reads.
