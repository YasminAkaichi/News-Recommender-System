As for those who persist in slander and distortion, history will expose them.”In this clarification, following the controversy over the dismissal of Tunisia’s Permanent Representative (PR) to the United Nations, the Presidency of the Republic added that ""Tunisia has not yielded to haggling or pressure, because when it champions rights, it only takes into consideration the legitimate rights ... the right of the Palestinian people is not a commodity that is weighed on the scale of profit and loss.”It stressed that ""the right of peoples to self-determination is a fundamental principle approved by international law, and neither the occupation nor attempts to give false legitimacy to it can change it"".In response to criticism of the decision to dismiss Tunisia’s PR to UN and to claims that pressure was exerted before the decision was made, the Presidency noted that ""the initiator of the Security Council draft resolution (in reference to PR Moncef Baâti), who was secretly instructed from Tunisia, did not seek to bring the draft resolution to a successful conclusion"".""The one who had put forward the draft knew in advance that it would meet opposition from more than one country, and that his objective, which is not hidden from anyone, was to harm Tunisia, and its president in particular, who has repeatedly affirmed that the Palestinian right is imprescriptible,” the Presidency added.It noted that ""what happened during the preparation of the draft Security Council resolution appears at first sight to be a championing of the Palestinian people, but this was only on the surface."" During the preparation of the draft, neither the Presidency of the Republic nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were consulted, it added.In the same context, the clarification considers that ""the one who took the role of defender of the Palestinian people’s right, has sought the sympathy of a number of capitals supporting what has been unfairly called a deal, to have the decision to dismiss him rolled back, and all that remains for him to do was to beg the Zionist occupier.”Tunisia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Moncef Baâti, whose dismissal was announced on Friday by the Presidency of the Republic, had submitted a draft resolution on the Middle East peace plan of U.S. President Donald Trump, proposed on January 28 (Deal of the Century), without co-ordinating with the Foreign Ministry or consulting the Arab group and countries that support the Palestinian cause, according to a source from the Presidency.The consideration of the draft resolution that was to be presented by Tunisia as a non-permanent member to the Security Council on Tuesday, February 11 has been postponed to a later date to deepen consultations on the issue and ensure best chances for adopting it, a source from the Presidency of the Republic told TAP on Monday evening.","10/02/2020 21:38, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Politics/12313999-dismissal-of-pr-un,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

Politics,"Tunisia calls UN Security Council to shoulder responsibility, reiterates need to comply with internatioanl legitimacy  ","(TAP) – Tunisia reiterated on Tuesday at the UN Security Council meeting in New York devoted to “the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question,” its commitment to continue its constant and principled support to the just Palestinian cause and to the legitimate, indivisible and imprescriptible rights of the Palestinian people, the Foreign Ministry said. In a speech delivered by Deputy Permanent Representative of Tunisia to the United Nations Tarek Al-Adab, in the presence of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, he pointed out the need to comply with the resolutions of the international legitimacy and to respect the basic benchmarks for the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace that would put an end to the occupation and helps restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, first and foremost the right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State with Al-Quds as its capital.Al-Adab laid emphasis on the need for the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibility in maintaining international peace and security and settling differences, and to endeavour to advance the peace process on the basis of an internationally agreed upon term in order to ensure that the brotherly Palestinian people's legitimate rights are restored, tensions brought to an end and security and peace ensured for all the region's peoples. The Deputy Permanent Representative of Tunisia pointed out that over the past few days, Tunisia and Indonesia, in close coordination with the Palestinian side, have engaged in consultations with the Security Council members, Arab and Islamic States and regional and political groups, in particular the Non-Aligned Movement, on a draft resolution that places special emphasis on the need to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy, including the Security Council's resolution 2334 of 2016 and the references of the Madrid Peace Conference and the Arab Peace Initiative, and an end to the Israeli occupation of all lands occupied in 1967, including Al-Quds East, to enshrine the two-State solution.Al-Adab affirmed that the Security Council session on the situation in the Middle East is held at a delicate moment in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, characterised by the escalation of tensions in the region, the halting of the peace process and the successive attempts to deviate from the resolutions of international legitimacy and the basic benchmarks for settlement.He also indicated that the Israeli occupation authorities continue to disavow the resolutions of international legitimacy and enshrine a de facto policy by expanding their settlement activities in the West Bank and Al-Quds East and threatening to annex parts of the Palestinian territory, in serious breach of international law, in addition to continuing the blockade imposed on Gaza and the various forms of attacks and collective punishment against the Palestinian people.In this vein, Tunisia called on the international community to assume its responsibility by speeding up the adoption of the necessary measures to put an end to these policies, that seriously jeopardize the chances to achieve peace and increase the level of tension and instability in the Middle East region.     The restoration of security and stability in the region is inherent to ending the Israeli occupation of all Arab lands and bringing Israel to submit to the will for peace and compelling it to enforce the UN resolutions, the official affirmed. Tuesday’s meeting was held just a few days after the Presidency of the Republic announced the dismissal of Permanent Representative of Tunisia to the UN Moncef Baati, after presenting a draft resolution on U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan proposed on January 28, known as the “Deal of the Century.”According to a source in the Presidency of the Republic, this decision was motivated by the presentation by Baati of this draft “without consulting with the Foreign Ministry nor the Arab group and the countries supporting the Palestinian cause.”The consideration of the draft resolution, which was due to be submitted to the Security Council on Tuesday by Tunisia as a non-permanent member of the Council, has been postponed to a later date in order to deepen consultations on the subject and ensure the best chances of adopting it, TAP learned on Monday evening from the same source.

Mansri explained that the Tunisian League of Women Voters, noted practices related to the exploitation of children in election campaigns, particularly in the constituencies of Ariana, Mahdia, Médenine, El Kef, Jendouba and Béja, saying that this practice is shown through the instrumentalisation of children in political campaigns to demand the release of presidential candidate Nabil Karoui. The report recommends, according to the same source, that all forms of discrimination affecting women in media in general and, in particular, those in the audio-visual media should be criminalised, especially since the media landscape tends to enshrine the invisibility of women active in political parties and independent lists, who have not enjoyed the same coverage as male politicians on television channels or radio stations.In this regard, the League has called on the Independent High Authority for the Elections (ISIE) and the Independent High Authority for Communication (HAICA) to formulate a bill that would enable them to exercise their authority over social networks, to draft a guide on monitoring electoral campaigns from a social gender perspective and to learn about the observation of gender-based political violence.","13/02/2020 16:01, TUNIS/Tunisia",https://www.tap.info.tn/en/Portal-Politics/12324006--parties,https://www.tap.info.tn/Files/Logos/636045259768177590_logo_tap19.png?v=5_10_2018_2

He recalled in this regard that the ISIE had proposed the threshold of 3% for the legislative elections, a threshold which will be taken into account during the municipal elections of May 2018.""The increase in the electoral threshold will surely lead to a change in the electoral quotient and increase the number of seats of the first four winning parties in the legislative elections.

Tunisia has not been affected by such a crisis since independence, Saied pointed out.Saied's meeting with Ghannouchi and Chahed also comes at a time when Ennahdha leaders have called for the application of Article 97 of the Constitution to avoid holding new elections.That outcome was rejected by the President of the Republic, who warned during the meeting of the ""seriousness of overriding the Constitution by the Constitution"". In this context, the Head of State considers that the text of the Constitution is clear and that Article 89 must be applied in the formation of the government.According to that Article: “If in the four month period following the first designation of a person to form a government, the members of the Assembly of Representatives of the people fail to grant confidence in a government, the President of the Republic may dissolve the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and call for new legislative elections to be held within a minimum of 45 days and a maximum of 90 days.” During this meeting, the Head of State ruled out the scenario of the application of Article 100 of the Constitution, as he said there is neither resignation nor death.""In case the government fails to win the confidence of the parliament, the word will return to the people,” he said, calling on all parties to assume their responsibility at this historic and decisive stage.The President of the Republic also referred to the concept of a caretaker government, based on several comparative experiences, stating that once the new parliament takes office, the government that was in place will become a caretaker government with very limited powers.""The institutions of the State will continue to function regardless of the outcome of the vote on the new government,"" the Head of State assured.The process of forming the government has experienced difficulties since Elyes Fakhfakh was designated by the Head of State to carry out this task, due to a dispute between the political parties involved in the consultations on the future government.
