sports,Amir returns to Pakistan squad after 5 year b,"strong>LAHORE: Left arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who was banned for five years from International cricket in spot-fixing case, has returned to the national squad announced for upcoming New Zealand tour.</strongMohammad Amir has been included in One-Day International and Twenty20 squads.Chief selector Haroon Rasheed announced that Mohammad Amir, Ahmed Shahzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Emad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Amir Yamin, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Mohammad Rizwan, and Saad Nasim will be part of the T20 team.The ODI squad comprises Ahmed Shahzad, Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Asad Shafiq, Babar Azam, Sohaib Maqsood, Zafar Gohar, Emad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Rizwan, and Mohammad Amir.Rasheed said that Amir's case has been forwarded to the New Zealand consulate and that his visa process will begin after the New Year's holidays.Amir, 23, resumed his career in March playing grade two cricket in Pakistan, after the ICC allowed his early return to cricket. He moved onto grade one and caught further attention in the Bangladesh Premier League where he picked up 14 wickets in nine matches at an average of 12.64.",1/1/2016,,
sports,Australia set to test twin spin attack against Windi,"strong>SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Year�s test starting this weekend.</strongAn inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen O�Keefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australia�s victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner O�Keefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.O�Keefe�s inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.",1/1/2016,,
sports,Australia skipper Smith plots return to test summi,"strong>SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.</strongSmith finished his annus mirabilis as the world�s top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australia�s best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australia�s highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australia�s copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lord�s.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this week�s third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.""It�s a huge motivation, that�s what we want to be, number one in all formats and we�re working extremely hard to get there,"" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.""It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. It�s been a good summer for us so far, so we�d like to finish on a high.""Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, February�s two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smith�s side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smith�s side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.""Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think that�s one of the big things we�re going to be judged on,"" Smith added.""It�s going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but I�m confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.""Smith�s own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australia�s only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.""I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again,"" Smith said.""All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.""Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week.",1/2/2016,,
sports,McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given �the benefit of the doubt� and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.�He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program,� McCullum said.�If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster,� added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.�He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended),� White said.�He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.�I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing,� added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",1/3/2016,,

England�s previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwag�s record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africa�s horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

sports,Australias spinners peg West Indies back in Sydney rai,"SYDNEY: Australia�s spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen O�Keefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather-disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday.More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop-start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start.Denesh Ramdin, unbeaten on 23, and Carlos Brathwaite (35 not out) will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away.The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and O�Keefe got plenty of turn off a straw-coloured wicket.Off-spinner Lyon (2-68) produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwood�s off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85.Left-arm orthodox spinner O�Keefe (1-42) then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil.Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne, West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test.After the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australia�s bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravo�s miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the opener�s glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip.

sports,Amla makes century De Villiers falls for 88,"CAPE TOWN: Captain Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century on the third day of the second Test against England and AB de Villiers made 88 as South Africa reached tea on 290 for three on Monday.Amla scored his first hundred for more than a year and De Villiers reached 8,000 Test runs before he pulled a short ball from Steven Finn to James Anderson at mid-wicket just before the interval.South Africa trailed the touring side by 339 runs, 140 short of avoiding the follow-on, with Amla on 132 not out and Faf du Plessis on 15.Amla and De Villiers resumed on 141 for two and extended their partnership to 183, giving South Africa a foothold in the game after England declared on a massive total of 629 for six on a second day of record-breaking batting.The experienced pair played with much circumspection but did offer chances.<br/> Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.<br/> (Reuters)�",1/4/2016,,
sports,Brathwaite cameo a bright spot in Sydney washou,"SYDNEY: Carlos Brathwaite shone briefly for West Indies but the rain was the only real winner on Monday as wet weather washed away all but 11.2 overs of play on the second day of the third Test against Australia.West Indies were 248 for seven in their first innings when the rain interrupted play for the third and final time half an hour after lunch in the wake of Brathwaite�s dismissal for 69.Play was officially abandoned at 4:35 p.m.(0535 GMT) as the rain continued to cascade down on Sydney Cricket Ground with the 14,266 optimistic souls who came through the gates despite the gloomy forecast offered a full refund.That meant that the flurry of boundaries with which Brathwaite lit up the few overs of action was ultimately a free show and the 27-year-old was warmly applauded for it by an appreciative crowd.Resuming on 35 with his team on 207 for six, the tall, muscular Bajan showed why he has been one of the few bright spots for West Indies on what has otherwise been a miserable tour.Playing his second Test after scoring 59 on debut in Melbourne last week, Brathwaite smashed four sixes and seven fours in his 71-ball innings.One of the two sixes he hit in one over off Australia paceman James Pattinson was a spectacular heave over the covers and deep into the crowd.A fuming Pattinson had his revenge, however, when he found his range and took out Brathwaite�s off stump with what the batsman described as a ""good nut"".""I was upset that once again I got a start and couldn�t carry on. One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize,"" Brathwaite said.""Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said �you know what, just enjoy the feeling�. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.""Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

To have them here in Cape Town is lovely and it is my mum�s birthday on the last day of the test so hopefully we can cap off a great game. �It was probably the best day of my life and one I will never forget.�After being recalled to the England side during last year�s Ashes triumph over Australia, Bairstow's place in the team has come under scrutiny. ""It has been a little while coming. There was a lot of talk here and there so I�m delighted to get over the line today,� he said.Stokes and Bairstow scored 399 in a record sixth-wicket stand as England declared on 629 for six on the second day of the second test at Newlands.It was a bludgeoning performance from Stokes, who scored a record-breaking 258 off 198 balls.""It was an exhibition of stroke play,"" Bairstow said. ""We just clicked in and supported each other all the way through. To play a knock like that is something quite spectacular.�I�ve grown up with Stokesy and seen him play some fantastic knocks and to witness that today was extremely special and something a lot of people will never forget.� England will seek to take an even firmer hold on the test on Monday by quickly dismissing South Africa, who closed on 141 for two.""It will be a strong move from us if we can come back in the morning and take some chances,"" Bairstow said. �Our bowlers have a wealth of experience in all different conditions and hopefully we can come out tomorrow, utilise a bit of reverse swing, moisture in the pitch and we go from there.""",1/4/2016,,

Maunganui on Tuesday.</strongHenry, who took four-wicket hauls in two other appearances in the series, finished with 5-40 as Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews had threatened to steal victory for his side.Mathews combined with his strong middle order to guide the run chase for 295 to snatch a draw in the series but when he was the eighth wicket to fall for 95, it effectively ended Sri Lanka�s chances and they were bowled out for 258 in 47.1 overs.Martin Guptill top-scored for New Zealand with 102 to give the hosts a competitive, though not daunting, total of 294 for five.New Zealand had ripped the top off Sri Lanka�s lineup to reduce them to 33 for three in the 10th over but Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal (50) produced a 93-run fourth-wicket partnership that was broken just as Chandimal reached his 15th half century.Mathews and Milinda Siriwardana (39) then put on 62 runs in 6.4 overs to take them to within 72 runs with nine overs remaining.The match then turned in the next three overs when Siriwardana and Chamara Kapugedara (10) were both dismissed, sending the required run rate over 10 and the chase effectively ended when Mathews became Henry�s fourth victim in the 46th over.While Guptill had top-scored in New Zealand�s innings, it was Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor, who both scored 61, played the anchor roles to allow the opener to score his 10th one-day international century.Guptill, the highest run scorer in one-dayers last year, hit nine boundaries and three sixes.He finished with 331 runs in the five-match series at an average of 82.75.Sri Lanka�s bowlers did an excellent job at the end of New Zealand�s innings by clamping down on their scoring rate that had threatened to push the score well past 300.The two sides now play two Twenty20 internationals, with the first at the same venue on Thursday.",1/5/2016,,

How do you win an election when you're prevented from campaigning?""Blatter and Platini were both banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) made to the Frenchman by FIFA with Blatter's approval in 2011 for work done a decade earlier.The committee said the payment, made at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election, lacked transparency and presented conflicts of interest, though both men denied wrongdoing.Platini had initially been seen as the favourite to replace Blatter in the Feb. 26 election where each of 209 national football associations who are members of FIFA hold one vote.""I had... about hundred of official letters of support from federations and about 50 pledges, in two days,"" Platini said.Five candidates, none of them clear favourites, will take part in the election and a chance for the job of rebuilding the sport's beleaguered governing body.They are Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne of France, UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino of Switzerland and South Africa businessman Tokyo Sexwale.Infantino has been Platini's right-hand man at UEFA and announced his candidacy after the Frenchman had been initially suspended in October.Champagne, although a compatriot of Platini, is known to be a critic, has no connections with UEFA and says that FIFA's priority must be to spread the game's riches more evenly around the world.",1/8/2016,,

Overall I�m not a big fan of that,"" the Frenchman said earlier on Monday.The breakdown presented by FIFA also revealed tactical voting among the 165 national team coaches, 162 national team captains and 171 media representatives who cast votes.Messi, eligible to vote as Argentina captain, named Barcelona team mates Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta as his top three.Portugal captain Ronaldo choose three Real Madrid team mates -- Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.Belgium captain Vincent Kompany opted for his compatriots Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne as his top two.More surprisingly, Spain captain Iker Casillas -- the former Real Madrid goalkeeper who now plays for Portuguese club Porto -- was among those who did not vote.Despite a red carpet and plenty of glitz, the event had a low-key air of predictability about it and was held against the backdrop of FIFA going through the worst corruption crisis since it was founded in 1904.The sport is facing criminal investigations in both Switzerland and the United States, where some leading FIFA officials are among 41 individuals and sports entities who have been indicted on corruption charges.Outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter, normally a central figure in the ceremony, was not involved after being banned for eight years by the Ethics Committee in December and there was no President's Award, usually given out by Blatter for outstanding services to the game.Past recipients have included Pele, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the Haiti national team, Queen Rania of Jordan and South African anti-apartheid activist and veteran cleric, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.Acting president Issa Hayatou played a low-key role, reading a brief speech before the start and appearing on stage when the awards for best player and women's player were presented.Ronaldo said the players did not want to discuss FIFA's problems.""We avoid answering this kind of question,"" he told a press conference before the ceremony.""We are professional football players, we compete every week, every day, we train and we just focus on that. These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.""In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53.",1/12/2016,,

He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza, one of his three scalps, as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168-run chase in the ninth over.Soumya Sarkar also made 43, but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over. Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings. Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half, until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.Bangladesh started well, but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over. But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs. Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami, who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket.Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th, 14th and 15th over, but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners. Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21-ball 29 by Al-Amin Hossain in the 16th over.Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe. The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir, who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20.With a series win out of the equation, Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20. ��",1/17/2016,,

sports,World tennis has been ripe for match fixing,"strong>SYDNEY: Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders.</strongTennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the game�s authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne.Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove.Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis.""If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, you�ll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins,"" he said.But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didn�t lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis.A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix.""It�s a one-on-one sport and what you do is, you�re the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match.And you can never get caught,"" Georgakis added.Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites, and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually, Patrick Jay, an independent betting expert, told the United Nations in 2015.In that sea of money, tennis is the second most active betting market, trailing only soccer, research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows.Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs, a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity.Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point-by-point or game-by-game with limits on those types of bets, pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match.""Say you want to throw a game but win the match, why would you bother? You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars,"" the gambler said.Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis.But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act.""Most money is won by betting on the favourite, which is not a good result for bookmakers,"" he added.""But if he�s up one set to love and then, in play, people start betting on the outsider�that would be us getting on the front foot, most likely, to say (to the authorities) �is there anything you need for us to look into?�,"" the bookmaker said.",1/18/2016,,
sports,Britains Konta downs Venus in Australian Open u,"MELBOURNE: Johanna Konta did not have to wait long after her stunning first round upset of Venus Williams at the Australian Open on Tuesday before having to field the inevitable questions about her national allegiance.Born and raised until her early teens in Sydney, the 24-year-old world number 47 moved to Britain in 2005 and plays under the flag of her adopted home.That background was not about to escape the attention of the local media, particularly after the impressive nature of her 6-4 6-2 win over the seven-times grand slam champion and former world number one.Asked whether she might consider switching her allegiance back to Australia, Konta was blunt. ""No,"" she said.""Unfortunately, my home is Great Britain. It has been for a long time now, over a decade. Yeah, no, that�s where my heart is.""Ah, jealousy is not a good thing,"" she grinned, as the questioner pursued the point by contrasting her victory with former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur�s first round exit.""I think Australian tennis is doing quite well, to be honest.""You have a number of very good players, and it�s -- what�s the word? It�s not a privilege, but it�s a compliment that you guys would say that, so thank you. But be grateful for what you guys have.""Apart from the local verbal tick of beginning her answers with a ""yeah, no"", Konta has gained more obvious benefits from her time in Australia.""My ability to deal with the heat,"" she said. ""I think I�m very lucky that I got to spend a lot of my young years here, because I got obviously exposed to the heat out here.""That was particularly beneficial on Tuesday when temperatures crept towards the 30 degrees Celsius mark on Rod Laver Arena.Because of her nationality switch, Konta is unlikely to be back on the main show court for her second round encounter with Carina Witthoeft or Zheng Saisai.

He also had another chance to get the title from a different organization with his fight against Keith Thruman last March and a close shave with Aaron Martinez in June.He was as lucky as whomever will win the Powerball jackpot when he was given a generous split decision against Aaron Martinez in June but even if you can stomach Guerrero in a world title fight the WBC clearly is violating its rules since it only ranks Guerrero sixth Rafael added.Meanwhile in case Garcia gets the win it will be the second time that he and Khan will fight against a title.Garcia who holds the record 31-0 with 18 knockout victories already fought with Khan for the junior welterweight title in 2012.",1/19/2016,,

I think I played unbelievable in the fifth set from the break,"" Verdasco said in a courtside interview.""I just started hitting winners. I don't know how. I was closing the eyes and everything when I was coming in.""I kept doing it so it went well.""After shaking hands with his opponent and the chair umpire Nadal strode quickly off the court, barely pausing to acknowledge the crowd with a wave.The only other time Nadal was beaten so early in a grand slam was when Steve Darcis sent him crashing out of Wimbledon in 2013.""The match is five sets... he was playing amazing in the last set,"" Nadal told reporters. ""He had a lot of success all the balls hitting full power in the fifth.""strong>'HAPPY FEELINGS'</strongBefore the tournament, Nadal had spoken of bringing ""happy feelings"" to Melbourne Park, after arriving his healthiest in years following a taxing off-season training camp.But his exit will do little to dispel the belief that the 14-times grand slam champion's best days are behind him.Nadal failed to progress further than the quarter-final of any of the grand slams last season, his first without a major trophy since 2004.Verdasco was inspired, however, hauling himself back from the brink with a stand-and-deliver game that mixed 90 winners with 91 unforced errors.It was partial revenge for his loss in an epic five-set semi-final against Nadal in the 2009 tournament, the second longest match recorded at the Australian Open.The 32-year-old served masterfully in each tiebreak, particularly in the second to keep the match alive, but wobbled early in the fifth when he was broken early.Fortune often plays a part in the defeat of Nadal and so it proved for Verdasco, who swung wildly at a second serve with the frame of his racquet, sending the ball cross-court to clip the line and break back to 2-2.He raised his hands in apology before acing Nadal to nudge ahead and ramped up the aggression on his more fancied opponent's serve.The pressure told on Nadal, who made his sixth double-fault to concede a break point, and Verdasco outfoxed the Spaniard in a fierce baseline rally to capture the decisive break.A raging ball of fire, Verdasco roared on to complete one of his finest victories and land a hammer blow on Nadal's early season confidence.""It's tough especially because it's not like (it) was here last year,"" added Nadal, who was beaten by Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals a year ago.""This year was a completely different story -- I had been playing and practising great and working so much, so it's tough when you work so much and you arrive at a very important event and you go out so early.""",1/19/2016,,

That would mean Blatter would have been paid for nearly five months during which time he was unable to carry out his duties, and a period in which FIFA has appointed an acting president, African soccer head Issa Hayatou.The compensation sub-committee of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee recently ruled that it could stop Blatter's bonuses but not, according to his contract, his salary.""Until the election of a new president on February 26, Mr Blatter is the elected president and therefore - according to his contract - is entitled to receive his remuneration,"" Bantel said.Blatter's U.S. lawyer and his Switzerland-based spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.FIFA is facing the worst corruption crisis in it history as a total of 41 individuals and entities, including many former FIFA officials, have been charged with corruption-related offences in the United States. The U.S. investigation is far from over and FIFA also faces a parallel Swiss probe.Blatter's bonuses have been stopped because he was not carrying out his duties of supervising the organization, including its general secretary.Only last week, FIFA announced that Jerome Valcke was fired from his position as general secretary.

S. Open ended in drama when she slipped and fell on the locker room floor and had to withdraw from the tournament with concussion.She later sued the United States Tennis Association and was unable to complete a match for the rest of the year.Though speaking of new beginnings in Australia and bringing a new coach in former Maria Sharapova mentor Thomas Hogstedt, Bouchard appeared to arrive with other baggage.Her encouraging run to the final of the Hobart International was ended with a 6-1 6-2 meltdown against Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, and she complained of being distracted by ""personal family issues"" at home.However, she tried to remain upbeat after her loss to Radwanska.

He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures, scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes.De Villiers, captain for his second Test, was out for his second duck in successive innings, caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series.JP Duminy was Moeen Ali�s second wicket, trapped lbw for 16 -- the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africa�s progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one.

But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition.He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Anderson�s delivery strayed down leg side.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch.Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgar�s stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf, allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground.Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali, hitting with some power, and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire.It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor, thriving in the most dangerous position on the field.South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket.Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg-side or pitched too short.

Then came Tendai Chisoro's three-wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2-2 with an 18-run win in Khulna.While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, Neville Madziva, the pacer, did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs.Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board. Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going. But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14-ball 18 in the seventh over.Mahmudullah, meanwhile, rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips, but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long-off. Along the way, he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13.Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6.3 overs as the scales started to tilt again. But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul, who was caught at cover. Mashrafe Mortaza, who has shown ability to wield the long handle, struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs.A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer. Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe. But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro. Abu Hider Rony swung his way around, but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts. He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win.The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket, but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80-run stand. Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes.Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes, using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck. He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil. Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25-ball 32, Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18-ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base.On the night, the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited-overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month. The jewel in Zimbabwe's twin wins to cap off their tour was Masakadza, whose 222 runs is a world record for most runs in aT20 bilateral series.���",1/22/2016,,

Konta will meet the Russian No21 seed, Ekaterina Makarova, after she eliminated No9 seed Karolina Pliskova.On this showing and her earlier efforts, Konta is now a serious danger to the higher seeds in her first Australian Open.

She was unable to engage in long rallies and grimaced between points.With speculation she might retire, No. 15 Keys returned to the court, but the pain only seemed to increase. Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout.

At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts.�",1/25/2016,,
sports,Raonic shocks Wawrinka to reach Australian Open quarter,"MELBOURNE: Milos Raonic struck a blow for the next generation of men�s tennis by flooring former champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Second seed Andy Murray, returning to court two days after his father-in-law was rushed to hospital, hit back for the old guard in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena though, banishing Bernard Tomic, the last home hope in the singles.Murray�s win capped a banner day for Britain following Johanna Konta�s advance, giving the nation men�s and women�s singles quarter-finalists at the same grand slam for the first time in nearly 40 years.Melbourne Park was rocked by corruption allegations on its opening day, and a week later, integrity fears returned as a former Australian professional player pleaded guilty to match-fixing at a Sydney court.Former world number 187 Nick Lindahl appeared in court just hours after a top global bookmaker suspended betting after heavy gambling on a mixed doubles match at Melbourne Park.The winning doubles pair dismissed suspicions over the match after being questioned by integrity officials. There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.""He�s sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better,"" the 13th seed told reporters.

sports,Murray downs Tomic to reach Melbourne quarter fi,"MELBOURNE: Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.""I just felt I was very uncomfortable,"" Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.""While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didn�t play the game the way I wanted to but he didn�t let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murray�s victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britain�s first men�s champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.

""I think that makes me play better.

Yes!"" as he pumped his fist at the ground.Murray served out the set to even up the contest again and grabbed two breaks early in the decider as the wincing Raonic�s level dropped, the Canadian�s racket feeling the brunt of his frustration after the first.Murray finished off his ailing opponent with a sublime crosscourt backhand volley to bring up a match point, which he converted with a handsome forehand winner.The 28-year-old pointed both index fingers at the roof of Rod Laver Arena before slumping into his courtside chair with a look of relief on his face.The relief will not be long-lived, however, as he will be back on the same court on Sunday attempting to dethrone five-times champion Djokovic.Murray�s older brother Jamie will be bidding for silverware on Saturday when he teams up with Bruno Soares to take on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek in the men�s doubles final.It is the first time two brothers have reached separate finals at the same grand slam.<br/> ""You�re not going to see it very often,"" Murray junior said.

sports,ICC decides to revoke special status of Big Thr,"strong>DUBAI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) borad has decided to revoke the special status of �Big Three� � BCCI, CA and ECB � and will try to reestablish the �independent� position of its chairman at the earliest.</strongThe decisions were made at the ICC Board�s first meeting of 2016, held at the ICC Headquarters here on Wednesday.According to a statement issued on Thursday, the board considered amendments that had been made to the ICC�s constitution in 2014 and agreed that, in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest and to follow best practice principles of good governance, it would seek to reestablish as quickly as possible the �independent� position of ICC chairman.The ICC board unanimously agreed to propose to the full council that a new chairman should be elected by the board for a two-year term starting from June this year through a secret balloting process overseen by the council�s independent audit committee chairman.�While in the office, the ICC Chairman will not be allowed to hold any post with any Member Board and may be re-elected at the expiry of the term with a maximum limit of three terms,� said the statement.In order to qualify to contest the election, it was agreed that all nominees must be either a past or present ICC board director and should have the support of at least two full member directors.The board also agreed to approve changes to the terms of reference of the Finance &amp; Commercial Affairs Committee and Executive Committee in a bid to remove the permanent positions for the nominees of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Cricket Australia (CA) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on these committees.The ICC will allow fair access to membership for all full and associate member directors, with the sole criteria being the skill, competence and experience of the relevant director.The present composition of the committees will be reviewed in their entirety in June 2016, it said.Moreover, the ICC board also agreed to carry out a complete review of the 2014 resolutions and constitutional changes with a view to establishing governance, finance, corporate and cricketing structures that are appropriate and effective for the strategic role and function of the ICC and all of its members.The board directed that the ICC�s constitution be reviewed in its entirety and urged all members to provide feedback on the issue to the management during the next few weeks.ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar constituted a five-member steering group, which he will will lead and also include the respective chairmen of the ICC�s governance review committee, executive committee, finance &amp; commercial affairs committee and associate/affiliate member group, and will be supported by various members of ICC management.The steering group will report on progress at the April 2016 meeting, with a view to putting forward any required changes to the meetings during the ICC Annual Conference week in June 2016.In a further attempt to improve the governance standards of, and transparency within, member boards, the ICC board agreed to reinstate a previous requirement that full members must submit to the ICC their latest audited statements on an annual basis, as is already the case with all associate and affiliate members.With an aim to improve relationships with the members and cricket stakeholders from around the world, the board decided that three of the four meetings of the year will take place in member countries outside of the UAE.�This year�s ICC Annual Conference will take place in Edinburgh from 27 June to 2 July, while venues for the April and October meetings will be announced in due course.�Shashank Manohar was quoted as saying: �We had very purposeful and positive meetings, and the decisions taken clearly reflect that we collectively want to improve the governance in a transparent manner, not only of the ICC but also the Member Boards.This, in turn, will enhance the image and quality of the sport. No Member of the ICC is bigger than the other and I am determined to make a meaningful contribution in this regard with support of all the Members.��",2/4/2016,,

sports,Marsh guides Australia to series levelling win in NZ,"WELLINGTON: Mitchell Marsh kept calm after New Zealand got the sniff of an unlikely victory and scored his sixth one-day international half century to guide Australia to a four-wicket win in the second match of their one-day series on Saturday.The victory levelled the three-match series at 1-1 with the final game in Hamilton on Monday.Australia have not lost a bilateral one-day series since India in October, 2013.Marsh scored an unbeaten 69 and combined with John Hastings (48 not out) in an unbroken 86-run seventh-wicket partnership for the visitors as they overhauled New Zealand�s 281 for nine with 3.3 overs remaining.David Warner top scored with 98 in Australia�s 283-6, and combined with the recalled Usman Khawaja (50) in a 122-run opening stand that had set the foundation for their victory.Mitchell Santner had almost taken the game away from the visitors with his left-arm spin, breaking the opening partnership and then trapping Warner leg before when the aggressive opener was within sight of his sixth one-day century.Santner then had Matthew Wade brilliantly caught in the deep by Adam Milne for two to reduce the visitors to 197 for six in the 33rd over and give the hosts a sniff of victory in a game they had not played well enough to win.Too many overs were peppered with boundary balls as they struggled with their length on a wicket that had little help for the bowlers.They had also not posted a big enough target as their innings suffered from fits and starts with all of the batsmen, apart from Henry Nicholls, laying solid foundations only to fall when they needed to build.Kane Williamson top-scored with 60, though the hosts� total was only pushed to a score considered defendable courtesy of a 61-run eighth-wicket stand between Santner (45 not out) and Milne (36).The 24-year-old Santner, who only made his international debut last year, is quickly impressing as an automatic selection in all formats of the game with his fluid batting and handy left-arm spin. (Reuters) -Saturday�s match showcased his blossoming capabilities, with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation.Santner, who was joined by the right-handed Milne 12 runs later, however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm, turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary.Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, however, ended the partnership, and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300, to finish with 3-61 from 10 overs.�",2/6/2016,,
sports,New Zealand set 282 for Australia in second ODI,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell-Hadlee series alive.Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late-innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon.Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott, while John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball.Nevertheless, Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time. Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing. His reward would come in consecutive overs, as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries.That put New Zealand five down, and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park. Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs, but the tourists could be happier with their effort.�",2/6/2016,,

He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end. Their late hitting pushed the total past 140 in the death, though, none of Peshawar's batsmen, barring Tamim, managed a score more than 16. For Islamabad, Russell took 3 for 31.�",2/6/2016,,

India plays Sri Lanka in the first semi-final at the same venue on Tuesday.<br/> <br/> Pakistan�s defeat prevented an all-Asian semi-final despite Umair�s man of the match-winning performance, but the West Indies played better all-round cricket to emerge deserved winner.Umair came to the crease in the 15th over with Pakistan struggling at 40 for four and rebuilt the innings in the company of Salman Fayyaz after half the side was back in the hut by the 21st over.Umair, who had scored 13 not out and 10 in previous matches in the tournament, hit 15 boundaries and two sixes before he was out in the final over.Salman remained unbeaten on a defiant half-century, which included three hits to the fence and a six.The revival came after a two-wicket burst by seamer Chemar Holder and fiery fast bowling by Alzarri Joseph, who conceded just 28 runs in his 10 overs.Once Joseph�s spell finished in the 36th over, Pakistan added a further 109 runs to set the West Indies a challenging target.The Caribbean flair was evident as the West Indies raced to 100 for one by the 16th over.Hetmyer and Imlach put on 77 for the second wicket to take the score to 122 for one, before two needless run outs saw the total slip to 147 for four.Shamar Springer was the fifth batsman to fall for 37 when 38 runs were still needed for victory, but Jyd Goolie (26 not out) and Keemo Paul (24 not out) saw their side home.Pakistan�s captain Zeeshan Malik congratulated the West Indies, but felt his team should have defended its score.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe upset the tournament�s defending champion South Africa by eight wickets to enter the Plate Championship final for teams that finished outside the top eight.Zimbabwe will take on the winner of the other semi-final between Afghanistan and New Zealand in the final on February 12.In a play-off for minor placings, Scotland defeated Fiji by 76 runs in another Plate match in Cox�s Bazar.

He hit Boland for two more sixes in the right armer's next over with the second dispatched over mid-wicket to bring up his 200th one-day international six.He is just the fourth player to hit 200 one-day sixes but the only one to have 100 in test cricket as well.He hit his sixth boundary off Mitchell Marshall in the 10th over when he guided the ball to the vacant third man boundary but was dismissed on the next ball with New Zealand 84-1",2/8/2016,,

sports,Root ton helps England reach 318 8,"CENTURION: Joe Root�s highest ODI score has left South Africa requiring a record chase if they are to avoid conceding a series-deciding defeat at the hands of England.Root's 125, the highest ODI score made by an England batsman against South Africa, has left the hosts needing to make the highest successful chase in an ODI at Centurion. West Indies' 300 for three, scored in 2004, is the record to date.In these days of great expectations of ODI scores, England's total of 318 for eight may not seem particularly extravagant. But on a cracked, two-paced pitch that challenges batsmen with uneven bounce, it is likely to prove a challenging target.South Africa lost the first two ODIs of the five-match series and are in danger of conceding defeat in the Test and ODI series to the same opposition during a home tour for the first time in 14 years.By the time South Africa struck for the fourth time, they could have been quietly satisfied with their work. Jos Buttler, again promoted to No. 4 to build upon the strong start from England's top order, had fallen first ball clipping to an intriguingly placed leg gully, while Eoin Morgan had laboured for 24 deliveries over his eight runs.But then Ben Stokes joined Root in a fifth-wicket stand of 82 in eight overs that took England's total from the average to the strong.�",2/9/2016,,

(and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.""It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.""Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.""We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so,"" Smith said.""The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.""New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.""I'm looking forward to these two test matches,"" McCullum said. ""It will be a great series, two evenly matched teams.""Not a better way to go out really.""",2/11/2016,,

sports,Dhawan bowlers power Indias series levelling wi,"RANCHI: On a dry surface in a dusty Ranchi ground, India's top order moved into customary home form, and their bowlers exposed a fragile Sri Lanka top order. Shikhar Dhawan was bruiser-in-prime, unleashing an early shellacking that brought him 51, and set the team on course to a big total. They reached 196 for 6, thanks to helpful hands from the top five, which today included a pinch-hitting Hardik Pandva. That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka.On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement, the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win, were expensive. Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat-trick - to Thisara Perera - barely made a difference, coming as it did in the penultimate over. Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first.R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top, and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here. Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball, and the chase never really recovered from that. Soon they were 3 for 16, Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps. Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory, and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs, as the required rate crept up through the teens. Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs.Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery, but departed soon after, nicking a throat-high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper. That wicket bought Sri Lanka brief respite. They bowled five overs for 30, before the runs began to flow again.Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over, with an athletic return catch, and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after, but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat. After two sighters he began his assault.Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge, taking particular liking to Chameera, whose figures he ruined. Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs, Chameera saw his third disappear for 18. His last also went for 10. In between Perera took a low-key hat-trick, having Pandya, Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses. His figures were dramatically improved as a result. He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs.Dilshan was stumped over-reaching off the first ball he faced. Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus, but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball, and chewed up four balls for one run. Danushka Gunathilaka amplified Sri Lanka's problems at the top of the order with another poor score.Kapugedara and Chandimal's 49-ball fourth-wicket partnership yielded only 52 runs. By the time they had departed, off successive Jadeja deliveries in the 12th over, the required rate had climbed to more than 14.5, and the chase was kaput. Dasun Shanaka and Milinda Siriwardana struck some late sixes, doing good to at least their own batting confidence, if nothing much for the team cause.��",2/12/2016,,

sports,Broad back as SA win toss and field in 4th ODI,"Stuart Broad returns to the England side for the first time since the 2015 World Cup.Broad was dropped from the white-ball sides after a disappointing tournament in Australia and New Zealand and also missed out on selection for England's World T20 squad, announced earlier this week.But he has never made any secret of his desire to return and has often stated his ambition to feature in the ICC Champions Trophy, in 2017, and the World Cup, in 2019. Both those events will be held in England.Broad enjoyed an excellent Test on this ground less than a month ago, where he claimed 6 for 17 in the second innings to help England secure the series.He may find conditions less helpful this time, though. There is a painfully short boundary on one side of the ground and the pitch appears to lack the cracks he exploited so well during the Test.Broad replaces David Willey in the side for this match, while Chris Woakes, who was also omitted from the World T20 squad, returns to the England side in place of Chris Jordan, who has taken one wicket in 17.3 overs in the series, at an average of 143 and an economy rate of 8.17.

Television replays showed the delivery was clearly legal.The tourists had earlier dismissed New Zealand for 183, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle reducing them to 51-5 in the 12th over and Nathan Lyon polishing off the tail after lunch.Hazlewood finished with 4-42, Siddle took 3-37, while off-spinner Lyon grabbed 3-32 and the tea break was taken 10 minutes early when Trent Boult was caught at long on for 24.Craig top-scored with 41 not out but the pitch appeared to have lost much of its bite by the end of New Zealand�s innings, which lasted 48 overs.Tim Southee, however, managed to get rid of both Joe Burns (0) and David Warner (5) to leave the visitors 5-2 in the third over and with the sell-out crowd in full voice.Southee and Boult kept up the pressure on Smith and Khawaja but when they scored 37 runs, from nine fours and a single, in 16 deliveries, the shackles were broken and crowd silenced.Smith was eventually dismissed about 20 minutes before stumps when he hit the ball back to Craig to end the 126-run partnership.The crowd began the day celebrating McCullum�s milestone as he became just the third New Zealander to earn 100 Test caps and the first man in world cricket to achieve them in succession from debut.Australia, however, seized control of the match shortly after Smith won the toss and simply bowled straight and waited for the ball to do just enough to catch the outside edge.New Zealand�s first seven wickets all fell to catches behind the stumps, but the last three, all Lyon�s victims, were caught in front from mis-timed attacking shots.

However, despite the defeat, other results in the tournament meant that Peshawar were through to the playoffs.Lahore, after being inserted, lost Chris Gayle for a first-ball duck, but Delport put up fifty-plus stands with Azhar Ali (25) and Umar Akmal to seize the advantage.Delport's partnership with Akmal for the third wicket yielded 101 runs; Delport hit six fours and three sixes for his 78, while Akmal's 31-ball 52 featured six fours. Their efforts ensured that Peshawar needed to chase at more than eight an over right from the off.Tamim Iqbal kept the runs flowing for Peshawar with a quick 30, but the team lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 95 for 4.Peshawar needed 70 runs from 46 balls at that time, but Malan blew new wind into his team's chase by blasting a 35-ball 42 with three sixes. His blows brought the equation down to 18 off the last two overs, but Malan was trapped lbw by Kevon Cooper off the first ball in the penultimate over, tilting the contest back Lahore's way.Peshawar needed 16 off the last over, and despite a six from Wahab Riaz, they could only muster 160 for 7.

sports,Van Niekerk stars in historic South Africa wi,"CAPE TOWN: South Africa recorded their first ever women's T20 victory over England to level the three-match series at 1-1. In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.�",2/19/2016,,

South Africa have won their last four matches batting second - three ODIs and the opening T20 - and du Plessis believes it has become a strong suit for a team that historically struggled when under pressure.South Africa made no changes to their winning XI from Cape Town which meant no space for Farhaan Behardien or Aaron Phangiso. Quinton de Kock is still being rested so Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers will get another chance to open together.England added some depth to their line-up with the inclusion of Sam Billings at the expense of David Willey.

sports,Sarah Taylor leads England to series wi,"JOHANNESBURG: Sarah Taylor scored a third successive half-century and became the second player after Charlotte Edwards to score 2000 runs in the format as England sealed the three-match series against South Africa 2-1. Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare. Tammy Beaumont, who had been moved down from opening to the middle, played confidently to finish unbeaten on 21.�",2/21/2016,,

The skipper even made a rare visit to the bowling crease himself, producing four overs of slow medium pace for three runs.Australia hold a 1-0 lead in the two-match series and only need to draw at Hagley Oval to retake the world's top ranking in test cricket.",2/22/2016,,

sports,Smith leads Australia back to test summi,"strong>CHRISTCHURCH: Australia returned to the top of the test world rankings on Wednesday after Steve Smith and Adam Voges steered the tourists to victory in the second test against New Zealand to seal a comprehensive 2-0 series win.</strongAfter thrashing the hosts in the first test by an innings and 52 runs in Wellington last week, Australia sealed the second match by seven wickets shortly after lunch on the fifth and final day at Hagley Oval.It was Australia's seventh win in 11 games under Smith's captaincy, while the match was also the 101st and final test for New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum, who now heads into international retirement.Australia were last at the summit of test cricket in July 2014 and Smith set course for a return when he assumed the captaincy from Michael Clarke full time after last year's Ashes loss to England.""We want to win every series we play. We want to win a lot more away from home and that was a good start for us,"" Smith said. ""We had a lot of patience in the way we played and ...all the guys are really confident in their skills.""McCullum, who will still play on the lucrative Twenty20 circuit, praised his team mates for their achievements during his reign as captain.""We've had some fun over the last few years,"" he said. ""We've achieved some things and hey, we've lost some games as well, but we've got our soul back and you're absolutely great men.""For the rest of my life I'll remember playing for New Zealand. I firmly believe this team will go to a new level over the next couple of years.""Magnanimous McCullum also congratulated Australia on their return to the top of the rankings.""You guys have proved why you are the number one test team in the world,"" he added. ""When you arrived here we felt we were a chance and you blew us off the park in both tests and showed why you are such a quality team.""Smith ended the match on 53 not out, his 16th test half century and follows up his 138 in the first innings. Voges hit the winning runs, a boundary through the covers to move to 10 and take the visitors to 201 for three.Australia had looked like achieving their victory target when they reached 169 for two at the scheduled lunch break before man of the match Joe Burns (65) was bowled by Trent Boult in the additional four overs offered by the umpires.Voges and Smith then opted to see out victory after the break.Usman Khawaja (45) was the only other wicket to fall in the first session on Wednesday when he was well held by McCullum at first slip off Tim Southee.Australia had only needed to draw the match at Hagley Oval to retake the top ranking in test cricket from India.",2/24/2016,,

sports,Blatter and Platini bans reduced to six year,"strong>ZURICH: Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, once the two most powerful men in world football, had their bans for ethics violations upheld on Wednesday, although they were reduced from eight years to six.</strongThe 79-year-old Blatter, who served for 17 years as FIFA president, and Platini, 60, one of the greatest players of all time and UEFA president since 2007, had appealed against the bans imposed last October.The ruling came two days before FIFA holds a special elective Congress to appoint a successor to Blatter, who was President of the ruling body from 1998 before standing down four days after winning his final term of office last May.Neither man will be at Friday's Congress following the decision and Platini could hardly contain his wrath.""The decision is insulting, shameful and is a violation of rights,"" he said in a statement.""The charges against me are baseless, built from the ground up and surreal in view of the facts and the explanations I gave during the hearing.""I will go to the end of my fight to show that I�m innocent, to restore my rights and identify who is responsible for this plot.""There was no immediate response from Blatter.strong>DARK NIGHT</strongThe pair will now turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for the last chance to restore their reputations and roles in the game.The final verdict from FIFA's headquarters, though, came on a rainy evening in Zurich.The statement issued by the Appeal Panel, while upholding the ban, did determine that ""some strong mitigating factors for Mr Platini and Mr Blatter were not taken into account when establishing the sanction.""One of the factors for reducing the ban was the pair's lifetime service to football.Blatter and Platini were banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.03 million) made to the Frenchman in 2011 by FIFA with Blatter's approval for work done a decade earlier.They said the payment honoured a verbal or gentleman's agreement made in 1998 for work carried out by the Frenchman when he was a technical adviser to Blatter.strong>SUSPENSION IMPOSED</strongThe decision not to overturn the bans followed the 12-year suspension imposed on Jerome Valcke, who was sacked as FIFA's secretary general last month.Valcke, the man responsible for running FIFA's day-to-day administration, was found guilty of misconduct over the sale of World Cup tickets, abuse of travel expenses, attempting to sell TV rights below their market value and destruction of evidence.Platini was European Footballer of the Year three times while Blatter worked at FIFA for 41 years after originally joining as Technical Director in 1975. He served as Secretary General from 1981 until he succeeded Joao Havelange as president in 1998.Blatter's reign was mired in controversy and the announcement that he was resigning came in June, less than a week after American and Swiss authorities arrested FIFA and other officials at a Zurich hotel on corruption charges, two days before the Congress and election took place.Platini was, for many years, regarded as Blatter's natural successor and they worked harmoniously before rifts occurred in their relationship.Platini was openly critical of Blatter in the run-up to last year's election, but both have been united again in being brought down by the scandal that has rocked their sport.��",2/25/2016,,

They include term limits for top officials and disclosure of their earnings.Whoever takes over from Blatter, who ran FIFA for 17 years like a globe-trotting head of state, will inherit a very different job with the focus on crisis management, after dozens of international football officials were indicted in the United States last year for racketeering, money-laundering and bribery.Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is the bookmaker's favourite with UEFA's Swiss general secretary Gianni Infantino a close second.Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein believes he is still firmly in the race however, while Frenchman Jerome Champagne and South African Tokyo Sexwale will hope to make an impact.There was little indication on Thursday, though, that the vote would be anything other than a two-horse race between Sheikh Salman and Infantino.""I am feeling good and very positive. The support I am receiving fills me with confidence,� Infantino told Reuters.A spokesman for his Bahraini rival said: ""Sheikh Salman is very confident about tomorrow�s vote.""The CONCACAF confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean opted against endorsing a candidate and delegates suggested that support within the region was divided.With no block vote from those 35 delegates, Africa's decision now looks set to be the decisive factor.African countries make up more than a quarter of the 207 football associations eligible to vote. On the final day of campaigning, there were sharply conflicting versions of how they would cast their ballots.While the vice-president of their continental federation said virtually all would back Sheikh Salman, several delegates told Reuters the African vote would be split.Infantino has said he was confident of winning more than half of the African votes, while Liberian football chief Musa Bility predicted the possibly unlikely scenario of 27 of the region's votes going to Jordan's Prince Ali.""The world is waiting and watching -- this is the biggest milestone in the history of FIFA. It will decide if FIFA goes ahead as we want or if it spirals down,"" Prince Ali told delegates.Former anti-apartheid militant turned businessman and politician Sexwale described FIFA as broken and a damaged brand, though he also referred to some of those felled in the scandal as ""friends we have lost"".Infantino repeated his promise to offer each of FIFA's members $5 million to invest in the sport over four years, more than doubling the $2.05 million each federation got from 2011-14. He said this could be achieved ""easily"" by tackling the cost structure of FIFA.Bahrain's Salman was again more cautious, though, speaking of a 'realistic' increase in funding.""For me, if the numbers are right, we can increase -- but I am not ready to mortgage FIFA�s future in winning an election.""French outsider Champagne took a shot at Infantino�s globe-trotting campaign by saying the election had been ""unbalanced"".""I did not have a private jet to visit you, take a photo and then tweet and say I have got the endorsement,"" he said to laughter from delegates.Prince Ali told UEFA delegates if he won the election he would appoint a European as his secretary general but did not offer up a name.CORRUPTION PROBESFIFA was plunged into turmoil by the corruption scandal that broke last year, beginning with a dawn raid to arrest delegates at a Swiss luxury hotel.Criminal investigations led by the United States and Switzerland have spanned dozens of countries, focusing largely on the awarding of lucrative broadcast and marketing rights to the world's most popular sport.They are also examining the process by which FIFA awarded the next two World Cups to Russia and Qatar.Acting FIFA president Issa Hayatou appealed to FIFA members in what he called one of the most important weeks in the history of global football, calling on them to back the package of reforms on governance.""I urge each of you to support the reforms in full here this week, and then to implement them to their entirety at home,"" Hayatou said in an address aimed at the six confederations that run football around the world.""This will send a strong message that we have listened and that we are taking the action necessary to give football the Foundation, and protection, it needs for the future.""",2/26/2016,,

sports,Pakistan looks to thrash UAE to bury demons of India def,"DHAKA: Coming jubilant from UAE following successful holding of Pakistan Super League (PSL), but the men in green conceded a humiliating defeat from arch-rival India in their Asia Cup opener, which they would want to forget as soon as possible starting with a big victory against minnows UAE when the two teams clash on Monday here in Mirpur.�For its part, Pakistan was taken by surprise at the way the pitch played on Saturday,� Shoaib Malik said after Pakistan was defeated by India.Pakistan slipped and slid to 83 against India, Sarfraz Ahmed�s 24-ball 25 the only innings of substance. Mohammad Amir put in a fantastic spell at the top of India�s innings to keep Pakistan in the game, but only just.�We made some mistakes. We didn�t know what the conditions here would be. Now we have played, now we know how to deal with it,� said Malik on the sidelines of the Pakistan team�s training session on the afternoon before the match.�We had miscalculated. It wasn�t a typical T20 wicket where you look at 170 or 180. We know we have the best attack among all teams. But the batsmen have to take responsibility. Whoever gets in has to score 60-70, so the team ends up scoring 140-150, which the bowlers can defend.�We should have scored 130. We had two run outs. Otherwise one of them might have gone on to score 40-50. Here, 130-plus is a great score, unless the conditions change.�<br/> <br/> It�s unlikely that Pakistan will be worrying too much about its bowling. Amir, as well as Mohammad Sami, bowled extremely well against India, while Mohammad Irfan troubled India�s batsmen no end. Wahab Riaz did, however, have an average day, but it could well have been an aberration.Like with UAE, it�s the batting that Pakistan has to address. And fast. Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have already beaten UAE and India could too, going by form. So winning on Monday is non-negotiable for Pakistan. But the idea must be put up a big performance - with the ball, of course; even more so with the bat.<br/> <br/> Since qualifying for this level in 2014, UAE has played three Twenty20 Internationals against Test-playing nations, two of them in this tournament and one against Zimbabwe earlier. To its credit, UAE have gone about it manfully, bowling well and showing good spirit on the field. Sri Lanka was restricted to 129 for 8 and Bangladesh for a similar 133 for 8.

sports,Wawrinka wins Dubai title after marathon tiebr,"DUBAI: Stan Wawrinka edged out Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in a nerve-jangling, near-30 minute tiebreak to secure the Dubai Duty Free Championship with a 6-4 7-6(13) triumph on Saturday.Wawrinka�s path to victory had been eased by the retirements of world number one Novak Djokovic and Australian prospect Nick Kyrgios in the earlier rounds but the Swiss often toiled against surprise finalist Baghdatis, whom he beat for a sixth successive time.World number four Wawrinka was gifted the first set by a Baghdatis double fault -- his third of that game alone -- and a tepid second set was notable for not featuring a single break point.But then followed a 28-point tiebreak in which twice grand slam champion Wawrinka saved five set points before a Baghdatis backhand drifted long to give the Swiss a second title of the year following his victory in Chennai in January.Baghdatis initially played serve and volley with aplomb, while Wawrinka�s stinging backhand was lethal from the baseline, but that early assurance proved fleeting as both players made a catalogue of errors.Wawrinka afforded Baghdatis two break points after whipping a forehand wide and the Cypriot converted following another wayward Swiss forehand for a 3-2 first-set lead.Wawrinka, who was within two points of suffering opening-round elimination at the Aviation Club, immediately broke back with a crosscourt winner past the advancing Baghdatis, who was seeking a first title since 2010.The pair were content to trade half-paced shots from the back of the court and when either did up the tempo it usually failed.World number 57 Baghdatis, serving at 4-5, saved four set points but his serve deserted him again as he conceded the set.The second set went with serve before an attritional tiebreak in which Baghdatis fluffed chances to square the match and Wawrinka threw his racket in frustration after missing an easy forehand.

sports,Chetty van Niekerk fifties set up SA wi,"EAST LONDON: Trisha Chetty and Dane van Niekerk both stroked half-centuries, paving the way for South Africa Women's 35-run win against West Indies Women in East London. Victory was not of much significance, though, as West Indies had already sealed the three-match series having won the first two ODIs.South Africa, opting to bat, compiled a score of 235 for 6, built on the back of two big partnerships. First, Chetty (55) and Mignon du Preez (43) added 72 for the second wicket, before Marizanne Kapp (39) and van Niekerk provided the innings late impetus by stringing together a 64-run fifth-wicket stand. Van Niekerk slammed 55 off 48 balls before being run out.West Indies, in reply, lost their opener Hayley Matthews early in the chase, but Shaquana Quintyne and Kyshona Knight led a recovery with a 57-run partnership for the second wicket. However, just when they seemed steady, the visitors lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 118 for 5. Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle offered the team some hope by adding 52 for the sixth wicket, but Aguilleira's wicket in the 43rd over left the lower order with too much to do, as West Indies could only muster 200 for 8 from their 50 overs.Masabata Klaas and Sune Luus snared two wickets apiece, while Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka and van Niekerk chipped in with one each.�",2/29/2016,,

Keeping the ICC World Twenty20 2016 in mind, Malinga probably will be fielded only if the team is confident that it won�t be harmful for him in the longer run.India might also be without Rohit Sharma, the inswinging yorker from Amir that sent him on his way on Saturday having left an impact on Rohit�s left big toe. He didn�t train on Monday, though it was announced that there was no fracture and Rohit wasn�t in any pain.The good news for India, meanwhile, was that Shikhar Dhawan was in fine fettle the day before the game, spending a fair bit of time knocking the ball around in the nets.<br/> <br/> India has been on a roll of late, while Sri Lanka hasn�t had things going its way. The last series either side played was against each other - a three-match affair in India, where India lost in the first match in Pune, but the then bounced back well to take the series 2-1.The pitches for all but one Asia Cup match have been pacer friendly, much like the track in Pune was, where Kasun Rajitha, Dasun Shanaka and Dushmantha Chameera made the big-name India batting keel over.Sri Lanka did that in Pune. But everything India did in the three games before that in Australia and then the remainder of the series against Sri Lanka and then here at the Asia Cup suggest a team at the top of its game, with most cogs of wheel spinning smoothly.If Malinga makes a great recovery and gets on to the field, Sri Lanka will wear a stronger look but still not be the favourite on paper, with India doing all the heavy hitting so far.Teams (from)India: MS Dhoni (captain &amp; wk), R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Shikhar Dhawan, Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pawan Negi, Ashish Nehra, Hardik Pandya, Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh.Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Dushmantha Chameera, Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Niroshan Dickwella, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Shehan Jayasuriya, Chamara Kapugedara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardena, Jeffrey Vandersay.

But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.�",3/8/2016,,

sports,Hosts with the most India eye World T20 cr,"NEW DELHI:� Hosts India are favourites to clinch the sixth edition of the World Twenty20 in what could be a fairytale ending to the glittering career of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India ranked number one in the world will seek to become the first side to win the International Cricket Council (ICC) title on home soil when the 16-team tournament gets under way on Tuesday.They are also gunning to become the tournament�s only two-time winners with South Africa Australia and the mercurial West Indies shaping as leading threats.Australia, the top�ranked Test side, are desperate to win their first World Twenty20 crown while Pakistan�s Mohammad Amir will play his first ICC tournament since returning from a five-year spot-fixing ban.India come into the tournament on the back of an eight-wicket win over Bangladesh in the Asia Cup final and have several key batsmen and bowlers in form.India�s hot streak of 10 wins from their last 11 T20 internationals, coupled with their vast and boisterous home support, means Dhoni�s men will be tough to beat.India also have added incentive to lift the trophy on April 3 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata because of the fact that the tournament may mark Dhoni�s swansong.Dhoni, who led India to the inaugural title in 2007, has struggled with the bat of late and turns 35 this summer.In-form batsman Virat Kohli and deadly off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin are expected to be the key men for India, who are hosting the championship for the first time.The home side start their campaign against New Zealand on March 15 before playing arch�rivals Pakistan in Dharamsala four days later in a hotly awaited clash.Pakistan endured a disastrous Asia Cup, thanks largely to some atrocious batting and any hopes they have of making an impression will rely on the performances of the controversial Amir.The 23-year-old fast bowler was banned and jailed for deliberately sending down no�balls in a Test match against England in 2010. But he has been in good touch since re-entering the international fold earlier this year and lit up the Asia Cup with a devastating 3-18 spell in Pakistan�s loss to India.Second-ranked South Africa are hoping to spoil India�s party and come into the tournament full of confidence following a T20 series whitewash against England.The Proteas have never won the World Twenty20 but anything less than the final will be considered a failure for the Faf du Plessis-led side, who boast top run�scorers AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla and leg�spinner Imran Tahir.Defending champions Sri Lanka are a shadow of the side that won in Bangladesh two years ago and have struggled to come to terms with the void left by legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.The West Indies tilt at a second title, have been hit by injury, withdrawals and a bitter pay dispute with squad members arguing with the country�s board over fees to play in the tournament.Experienced batsman Darren Bravo, all-rounder Kieron Pollard and off-spinner Sunil Narine are all out but it would be unwise to write off the third-ranked Windies, especially when they boast the big-hitting Chris Gayle.The preliminary round starts on Tuesday with Afghanistan and Bangladesh favourites to join the big eight teams in the Super-10 group stage.In Tuesday�s opening matches, Hong Kong take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan play Scotland.��",3/8/2016,,

sports,Jury finds hotel liable in Erin Andrews stalker video ,"strong>A jury on Monday found a Nashville hotel liable for a nude video of sportscaster Erin Andrews that went viral and awarded her $55 million in damages to be paid by the hotel and the man who shot the video.</strongAndrews sued the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University over a 2008 video of her that was taken by a stalker in an adjoining room and posted on the Internet in 2009. Andrews, a Fox sportscaster who used to work for ESPN, had sought $75 million in damages.""We're disappointed with the outcome,"" defense attorney Marc Dedman told reporters. He said he would consult with his clients - the hotel owners and its former operators - on whether they would appeal.Jurors began deliberating on Monday morning after the two-week trial concluded on Friday.""I've been honored by all the support from victims around the world. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyone's safety, security and privacy,"" Andrews said in a brief statement on her Twitter feed.Andrews testified for two days during the trial, saying that since the video was seen by millions of people, she experienced serious mental injury, including depression, crying spells and sleeplessness.Her lawyers argued that the hotel was negligent and could have prevented the incident.The video was taken by Michael David Barrett, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to stalking Andrews and making the video. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Barrett asked the hotel to put him in a room next to Andrews' after an employee confirmed to him that she was staying there on a certain date. He rigged a peep hole to shoot the video of Andrews while she was changing.Lawyers for the hotel argued that the responsibility was solely Barrett's and there was no way the hotel could have foreseen what he did.The parties who were found liable were West End Hotel Partners, the investment group that owned the Nashville Marriott, and the operating company of the hotel at the time, Windsor Capital Group. Marriott International was originally named in Andrews' lawsuit, but the judge removed it.The jury found that the hotel is liable for 49 percent of the $55 million in damages, or $26.95 million, while Barrett is liable for 51 percent of the damages, equivalent to $28.05 million.",3/8/2016,,
sports,Tennis star Sharapova faces suspension after failing drug ,"strong>LOS ANGELES: Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova, the highest-paid woman in sports, said on Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she has been taking for 10 years for health issues.</strongThe 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1.""I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. ""I take full responsibility for it.""""I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" former world No.1 Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel.The ITF's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence. If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements.Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""The World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova and Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium.Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.�",3/8/2016,,

sports,South Africa women clinch thriller to take series 2 1,"CAPE TOWN: South Africa staged a sensational comeback in defence of a below-par total to claim a first T20 series win over West Indies and sound a warning ahead of the World T20.South Africa's victory came less than three weeks after they beat England for the first time in a T20 and illustrated the progress the team has made since September 2014, when they were beaten 4-0 by England.West Indies, who have not lost a series in the same period of time, will be disappointed with their failure to complete a straightforward chase, especially as they were well on course.They had reached 81 for 3 in the 15th over and even though their captain Stafanie Taylor had been bowled around her legs by Dane van Niekerk, they had their other stalwart Deandra Dottin on hand.Dottin seemed to be striking the ball better than any of her team-mates but when she attempted a loft over long-on, she mistimed to spark a collapse. South Africa took four more wickets in the next 18 balls and then squeezed at the end to pull off a remarkable win.South Africa recovered from an early blow when Shamilia Connell had Trisha Chetty caught at slip and rebuilt cautiously through van Niekerk was joined and Mignon du Preez.The pair found the boundary just five times but rotated strike well to score at more than a run-a-ball and put on 48 for the second wicket. When van Niekerk was bowled as she tried to slog sweep Taylor over midwicket, and with the run-rate stagnating, du Preez took it on herself to try and force the pace. She managed only to gift a catch to short midwicket.Marizanne Kapp and Lizelle Lee also found it heavy going but with South Africa yet to reach 100 and only two overs left, they took some risks. Lee was the only batsman to clear the boundary and her efforts at the end gave South Africa something to defend but when West Indies knocked off the first 14 runs inside two overs, they would not have expected to be successful.Moseline Daniels had Kycia Knight trapped lbw to provide some early hope but that only brought Taylor to the crease. She tried to end matters quickly with her aggressive approach and when she was bowled, Dottin took over. It was only when Dottin was caught that South Africa fought back.Kyshona Knight departed soon after Dottin, sharp fielding resulted in the run-outs of Shermaine Campbell and Shaquana Quintyne and Shabnim Ismail took a good catch off her own bowling to give South Africa belief. Daniels and Ismail bowled tightly at the end and South Africa's fielders were on high alert to deny West Indies.�",3/9/2016,,

sports,Van Meekeren seals Netherlands sign off victory,"DHARAMSALA: Netherland defeated Ireland in a dead rubber curtailed by rain to six-overs-a-side World Twenty qualifiers Group A match here on Sunday.Netherland after sent into bat, made 59 for five in six overs and later restricted Ireland to 47 for seven to win the match by 12 runs.There was snow on the mountain tops in Himachal Pradesh, if the drizzle had cleared the temperatures were plunging and Ireland felt the chill as once they were again tormented by the side in orange.The orange flash at deep midwicket that sparkled most brightly of all came 14 balls into Ireland's pursuit of 60 and belonged to Pieter Seelaar as he sprinted along the midwicket boundary before clinging to a slick diving catch.Paul van Meekeren banged the ball in back of a length, Kevin O'Brien's pull was middled, but the shot that might have broken the run chase (had it gone for six Ireland would have been 34 for 1 after 14 balls) was instead the harbinger of Ireland's growing despondency.As for van Meekeren, a return of 4 for 11 will awaken a little interest, one suspects, in English county cricket. By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him. Tom Cooper slogged his third ball to mid-on, affording the opportunity to prey upon Roelof van der Merwe who was promoted to No. 3.It did not work out for van der Merwe. Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six.

I�m fit and strong to play,� Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday.Steyn, who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems, has seen an improvement in South Africa�s limited-overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris.�When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence,� Steyn said.�I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls.�It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team, even in that two month gap.�South Africa play their opening two World Twenty20 matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam-friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur, which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday.�I�ve always said that I can bowl on any track,� Steyn said.�I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning. The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground, especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground.�As a seamer I back myself. I can bowl fast cutters, it�s difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when it�s coming at 140 or 145 and is gripping and stopping.�",3/17/2016,,
sports,India Pakistan look to tune out India Pakistan hy,"India's cricket team is undoubtedly, indisputably, unarguably, and by a massive distance, better than Pakistan's cricket team. At football.It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams' training sessions on the eve of their World T20 clash at the Eden Gardens. If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it. And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah-ul-Haq.It is an India-Pakistan clash at a World tournament, and it will come with the inevitable trappings. Famous people will sing national anthems. Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance. Sachin Tendulkar will be there. So will Imran Khan. And Sunil Gavaskar. And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich�.""This rivalry is huge,"" he said. ""It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.""So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.""It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.""History can change, too,"" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. ""We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.""In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.""India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.""I think it was more about trying and relaxing,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.""What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.""India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, ""On the field is the safest and quietest place for you"". And until they actually get on the field, the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket. It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young-again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout.",3/18/2016,,
sports,Australia women record easy win over South Africa ,"NAGPUR: Australia began their title defence with a six-wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. It was vice-captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end, after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over.South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat. Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood, indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6. As hard as they tried, defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title.Eventually, the batting meltdown played a big part in the result, as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52-run fifth-wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare.South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72-run opening stand with Trisha Chetty, before Australia strangulated them.While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace, Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect. Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100-run mark.Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner. Alyssa Healy walked across to flick, only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired-up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff. Perry bottom-edged a cut to the wicketkeeper, while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures.Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket. But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket. When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped, the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4, needing 50 off 47 balls.Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs. Once within striking distance, the feared white-ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts, to convert a tricky chase into a cruise.��",3/18/2016,,

By the end of the Powerplay, New Zealand were 48 for one and except for a couple of quiet overs, the pair found the boundary with ease.Devine fell in the 15th over to Isobel Joyce, after a 34-ball 47, and Bates then propelled the score past 150.The New Zealand captain struck two successive sixes off Kim Garth in the penultimate over before falling for 82; her knock also included seven fours.She became the fourth player to score more than 2000 runs in women's T20I cricket and is second on the list of highest run-getters with 2063 runs, ahead of Sarah Taylor and Stafanie Taylor.Ireland's chase simply failed to get off the blocks. They lost two wickets within the first four overs for a score of 16 and by the tenth over had reached only 34 for 3.The required run rate was already more than 14 by that stage and it was only Joyce who showed some resistance with a 33-ball 28, the top score in an Ireland innings that eventually petered out to 84 for 5.Offspinner Leigh Kasperek had economical returns of 1-10 in her four overs while legspinner Erin Bermingham took 2 for 17.�",3/18/2016,,

The aggregate remuneration of key management personnel was $27.9 million.Blatter had been FIFA president since 1998 and his salary had long been the subject of speculation.

sports,South Africa defend 200 plus total to beat Afghani,"MUMBAI: South Africa survived a spirited Afghanistan chase to defend a 200-plus score and get their World Twenty20 campaign back on track.Chris Morris and Imran Tahir squeezed through the middle period to ensure AB de Villiers' quickfire 64 was not in vain, he took 29 runs off Rashid Khan, which ended up being the major difference between the two sides.In the end, South Africa will be relieved that they were able to defend their total, but disappointed that the margin of victory was not bigger. They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out. Abbott and Morris got the yorker right more often than they did in previous matches and Rabada managed one at the end, but South Africa will not feel it was a complete performance by any means. �",3/20/2016,,

He leaves a very important legacy for our family of football. We have lost a great man.""Maradona said: ""We will never forget you, mate"" while another Argentine Lionel Messi, the world's best current player, added: ""Another legend has left us today.""Cruyff, who had announced last October that he was suffering from lung cancer, had said only last month that he was ""2-0 up in the first half"" of his battle against the disease.Poignantly, that turned out to be one of the last public statements made by the sage whose observations on the modern game were eagerly courted in global football, with his weekly column for De Telegraaf newspaper a must-read until the end.Cruyff died surrounded by his friends and family at his home in Barcelona, according to his official website.The news prompted eulogies from his home country with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, saying: ""The whole world knew him and, through him, the world knew the Netherlands.""The Netherlands' international against France on Friday in Amsterdam will be halted for a minute-long silence after 14 minutes in tribute to Cruyff, who wore the number 14 in his playing days.In his adopted home of Barcelona, though, the loss was just as keenly felt with Cruyff having become an iconic figure in the Catalan city, where their current world-beating team, featuring Messi, still bears the hallmarks of his attacking invention.As Pep Guardiola, one of his successful and influential successors as Barcelona coach, said: ""He painted the chapel and Barcelona coaches since have merely restored or improved it.""�",3/25/2016,,

Three balls later, Atapattu pinned her opposite number Mignon du Preez plumb in front for a duck, a wicket the Sri Lanka captain identified as the ""turning point"" at the post match-presentation.Left-arm spinner Sugandika Kumari and left-arm pacer Udeshika Prabodhani backed Atapattu to squeeze South Africa's middle order. From 50 for 0, South Africa slumped to 102 for 7. Du Preez said: ""We had a good start and we lost it in the middle order. We have been struggling with it in the whole tournament. It was also poor execution from us. This is something we need to work on and come back stronger.""Prabodhani speared in full balls and defended 12 off the last over, including taking the wicket of Chloe Tryon for 11 off 10 balls. Though it was only a dead rubber, Sri Lanka toasted the win, and got into a huddle only after wicketkeeper-batsman Dilani Manodara had joined the side from the dug out.Manodara was pinged on the grille of the helmet when he missed a scoop off her first ball. She scratched around for 4 off 9 balls, before she was bowled by seamer Marcia Letsoalo. She was later sent to the hospital for a scan, and it was found that she had no major injuries.Sri Lanka's middle order folded as well and they managed only 34 for 4 in their last five overs. Atapattu, however, had lifted Sri Lanka with a bevy of muscled slog sweeps. She hit 52 off 49 balls before she was run out by Marizanna Kapp who was featuring in her 50th T20 international. She picked up two wickets and was complemented by legspinner Sunne Luus who also scalped two wickets.But Attapattu's act proved to be too much for South Africa. ",3/28/2016,,

""I think I have got Brian in second spot now.LARA�S PRAISEThe West Indian batting great was also bowled by what he saw and requested videos of Kohli�s early days, hailing the Indian as the ""best timer of a cricket ball"" that he has seen.At 27, Kohli stands on the brink of batting greatness with 36 international centuries against his name and averages of 44 in tests, 51 in one-dayers and 55 in Twenty20 matches.It has been a fascinating transformation of a Delhi cricketer perceived initially as yet another brash brat from the streets of a city long accused of inculcating aggression in its youth.Since Kohli�s international debut in a one-dayer against Sri Lanka eight years ago, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has closely watched the tattoo-wearing, blunt-speaking, heart-on-his-sleeve youngster transform into a mature match-winner.Kohli hates the idea of an on-field confrontations that doesn�t include him and Dhoni argued it suits the player who succeeded him as India�s test captain.""He will always be the same,"" Dhoni said after the victory in Mohali. ""He will be an aggressive character who will be ready to take on challenges and he will be aggressive on the field.""But he will also improve.

sports,WT20 Peaking England meet soaring Kiwis in first semi,"strong>NEW DELHI: England skipper Eoin Morgan would like to believe his team peaked at the right time at the ongoing World Twenty20 while New Zealand were slightly premature going into Wednesday�s semi-final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.</strongKane Williamson and his Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India, winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi-finals as the tournament�s only unbeaten team.For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with, England�s passage proved bumpier.Even before they could soak in the atmosphere, England were blown away by a Chris Gayle century in their tournament opener against West Indies in Mumbai.Joe Root sparked their recovery in the 230-run chase against South Africa but the narrow victory against Afghanistan�s modest resources exposed their frailties against spin bowling.They looked a significantly better side, however, in Saturday�s 10-run win against champions Sri Lanka.Jos Buttler underlined his limited overs worth with a belligerent fifty, the pacemen made regular inroads, Ben Stokes delivered a tidy final over and the team held their nerve to secure a victory that seemed to tick most of the boxes.""In these tight tournaments you can�t get through to the semis unless you are playing good cricket, and that�s what we set out to do to give ourselves a chance,"" coach Trevor Bayliss said.""But it�s about peaking at the right time.I wouldn�t say we�ve played the perfect game yet -- coaches are always looking for that absolutely perfect game, I don�t think it�s ever been played -- but it�s what any team is striving to do.""Having played their last two games at Kotla, England would also hope to cash in on their familiarity with the venue in contrast to their opponents who were on a mini-tour of India playing each of their four group games at different venues.strong>KIWI ADAPTABILITY</strongThe trouble for England, however, is that New Zealand won all of them as the team, finalists in last year�s 50-over World Cup, strive to shed the tag of being cricket�s perennial bridesmaid.Leading from the front, Williamson has also displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this.New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener, picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India, renowned for their batsmen�s comfort against the turning ball, in their own game.Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result, his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis, claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches.And if Williamson has noticed England�s struggle against Afghanistan�s slow bowlers, the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullum�s control and accuracy in a three-pronged spin attack.As demonstrated by Martin Guptill, the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart-warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations.""It hasn�t been the wham, bam...sort of way that T20 cricket has been,"" batting coach Craig McMillan said after the victory against Bangladesh in their last group match.""They have had to assess it...and have done a really good job of putting the runs on the board to give the bowlers something to work with.""",3/29/2016,,

New Zealand's surprise package - the spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi - still lay in wait.The pitch appeared to have a little grass, but given the venue's history that did not mean there would be much response for bowlers of any type. England's two previous games, against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, had been played on slowish surfaces, one dry and slow, one damper and a little quicker, but neither offered much turn.Almost no one would have expected New Zealand to leave both Trent Boult and Tim Southee out for the entire group stage, yet the semi-final had arrived and they were excluded once more.England: Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jos Buttler (wk), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Liam PlunkettNew Zealand: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (captain), Colin Munro, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghan�",3/30/2016,,

sports,Windies board offers talks with new T20 ,"KOLKATA: The West Indies board has offered talks with its new World Twenty20 champions to defuse a long�running dispute saying it wants to find ways of ensuring players don�t turn their backs on international cricket.The Windies� victory in the final in Kolkata on Sunday night was soured by an outburst from skipper Darren Sammy who said it was disappointing the team had received no support from the board before the match.Dave Cameron, the board�s president responded by calling the comments inappropriate in a statement that reserved its warmest words for the tournament organisers rather than the victorious players.However, Cameron did offer an olive branch by saying the board would meet players after the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) next month to persuade them to play for the West Indies rather than opt for lucrative Twenty20 leagues.�We want to see how we can find common ground in ensuring that the best players in the region are available for selection for West Indies teams�, Cameron said.�We are fully aware of the financial rewards on offer in the lucrative international T20 leagues but we believe deeply in the importance of cricket to the people of the region and of West Indies cricket s place in world cricket. It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection.�Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards.A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began.Many senior players, such as Chris Gayle, no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year.When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year, Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australia�s Big Bash T20 tournament.Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes.Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May.�We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time�, �said Cameron. �We will also engage the ICC on this so that we protect not only the rich heritage and legacy of West Indies cricket but also its future�, he added.",4/4/2016,,
sports,Waqar Younis steps down as head ,"strong>LAHORE: Waqar Younis has resigned as Pakistan's coach three months before his contract was going to end, and only one day after Shahid Afridi stepped down as the T20 captain. Waqar took the decision after meeting PCB officials in Lahore.</strongThe two resignations came after Pakistan's disappointing performances in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh and the World T20 in India. Pakistan won only three games out of the eight they played across the two tournaments and failed to make it beyond the first round. The last series Pakistan won in any format was last October, when they beat England 2-0 in a three-Test series in the UAE. After that, Pakistan lost the ODI and T20 series to England, and then traveled to New Zealand to again lose the T20 and ODI series. They won only two of the 12 limited-overs matches they played in all against England and New Zealand. Pakistan are currently ranked a respectable fourth in Tests, but eighth in ODIs and seventh in T20s in the ICC rankings.Waqar had recently presented a scathing report, after Pakistan's exit from the World T20, in which he criticised the PCB's decision of not giving him a say in the selection process and lambasted Afridi's style of captaincy. The report was an overview of his two-year term as coach and was submitted to PCB chairman Shahryar Khan and to the board's fact-finding committee.A day before submitting that report, Waqar had offered to step down but had said cosmetic changes would be insufficient to solve the deeper issues in Pakistan cricket.It was Waqar's second tenure as coach after he was appointed in May 2014 for a two-year contract. His first stint as head coach was in 2010-11 and he had then resigned citing personal reasons.�",4/4/2016,,

It was won, it was lost, then won, then lost. No side really deserved to lose it,"" former England captain Nasser Hussain wrote in his Daily Mail column after West Indies chased down England�s 155 for nine on a difficult batting surface.Fellow former England skipper Michael Atherton wrote in The Times: ""It was a stunning end to a stunning tournament that showcased the best of the modern game -- a game in which England played a full part for once.""The Daily Telegraph described Brathwaite�s onslaught as ""four balls that stunned the world"" with its correspondent Jonathan Liew writing: ""It was one of the most remarkable victories ever known.""A match that will resound well beyond the boundaries of this stadium, well beyond the boundaries of Twenty20 as a finish for the ages.""While Brathwaite�s incredible display of power-hitting allowed the Caribbean side to become the first to win the World Twenty20 title twice, there was plenty of sympathy for England bowler Stokes, who was on the receiving end of the late mauling.England skipper Eoin Morgan said: ""Ben is going to be devastated.<br/> Cricket can be a cruel game, it will take its toll over the next couple of days but we share the pain, we share the success.""Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, one of the greatest batsmen of recent times, also had sympathy for Stokes saying on ESPN that he was punished by Brathwaite because his deliveries were not quite accurate enough.""But I feel sorry for Ben Stokes -- and a lot of the bowlers in this day and age,"" he added.<br/> Meanwhile, former Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee was full of praise for the victors and their approach towards Twenty20 cricket.He told ESPN he had written about their batting prowess in his newspaper column before the tournament began and said it was that power that secured victory in the end.""There has never been another six-hitting team like this one, and that turned out to be the clincher,"" he said.",4/4/2016,,

sports,National Assembly apprised on cricket teams failur,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Friday was apprised on the Pakistan cricket team s poor performance in T�20 World Cup saying only one cricketer was representing Pakistan Cricket Board s (PCB) management.Only one cricketer was representing Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) management and its affairs were being run by non-cricketers majority merely focussing on perks and privileges rather than cricket team�s performance.This was stated by the Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination, Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada while responding to a Calling Attention Notice raised by Khalida Mansoor and others regarding poor performance of Pakistan cricket team during the T20 World Cup.He said that it was a matter of great concern that national team could not perform well and batting line particularly top three badly flopped, he added.The minister said efforts were being made to review its past glory.Under short term measures, selection committee was being changed besides replacing the captain of the team, he said and added new coaches were also being hired.Riaz Hussain said for next assignment, camp would be set up at Abbottabad to acclimatize the players with England�s environment.The minister said that he had also forwarded the name of Majid Khan to the Prime Minister who is the patron-in-chief of the PCB.�",4/8/2016,,
sports,Kolkata Knight Riders rout Delhi Daredevi,"KOLKATA: Kolkata Knight Riders responded with a 'horses for courses' approach on a greenish Eden Gardens surface. Shakib Al Hasan and Morne Morkel, central to their plans last season, were benched.Sunil Narine, who played a stellar role in their title-winning run in 2012 and 2014, was unavailable because of his father's demise. Did it hamper them? It didn't look like, as Andre Russell and Brad Hogg took three wickets apiece to skittle Delhi Daredevils for 98. Robin Uthappa and Gautam Gambhir's 69-run opening then set the tone for a comfortable win with 35 balls to spare.Russell and John Hastings, taking Morkel's place, ran in hard and hit the deck to extract unusual bounce. Quinton de Kock, who had pulled Umesh Yadav for back-to-back boundaries, was the first to go when he skewed a catch to mid-off. Three balls later, Shreyas Iyer was trapped lbw for a duck.Mayank Agarwal and Karun Nair also exited in successive overs as Hastings capped the Powerplay with a wicket maiden. By then, Daredevils were in a familiar spot at 35 for 4. Pawan Negi, who was promoted to No.6, swished and missed balls. He was finally put out of his misery when Hogg had him stumped for a 19-ball 11.IPL debutant Carlos Brathwaite, who fired West Indies to their second World T20 title last week, momentarily broke the shackles with a biff over wide long-on, but was foxed by a skiddy googly from Piyush Chawla two balls later. Sanju Samson was the eighth Daredevils batsman to be dismissed before Hastings made a reappearance to wrap up the innings. Daredevils had slumped to their seventh sub-100 score in IPL, which also happened to be the second-lowest score in the tournament's history at Eden Gardens.The chase was a stroll for Knight Riders, and the onset of dew only made things worse. Zaheer Khan, playing his first competitive game since May 2015, floated flick-me balls in the lower 120kph range to Gambhir's pads and got picked away for three fours in the second over. Uthappa got into his shot-making stride with a brace of straight-driven fours as the hosts raced past 50 in the eighth over.Although Uthappa holed out for 35 in the tenth over against the run of play, Gambhir and Manish Pandey ensured Knight Riders enjoyed a winning start.�",4/10/2016,,

I am happy to win another title here and this triumph certainly boosts my spirits ahead of the Olympics.Chen called Lee a role model for young Malaysian shuttlers and said he was happy to have qualified for the final.It is not easy for a player at his age to maintain a high�level performance year�in year�out and you can see the crowd really appreciated that said Chen.I felt I played well but it was my first time playing in this court and perhaps the drift was too strong.Lee had missed last year s edition because of a suspension after testing positive for a banned anti�inflammatory substance at the world championships in Copenhagen in 2014.

sports,Gujrat begin IPL campaign with 5 wkt win over Punjab,"MOHALI: Aaron Finch and Dwayne Bravo helped Gujarat Lions ease into the IPL with a thumping win against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali, the third one-sided affair of the season in three games.Barring the first over, Lions were in total control of the 162 chase after Finch set it up with his first IPL fifty since 2014.Brendon McCullum, fresh off a whirlwind ton in his last Test, danced down the track off Sandeep Sharma in the first over with keeper Wriddhiman Saha standing up.Sandeep, though, anticipated a forward shimmy and bowled the perfect outswinger to leave McCullum stranded. Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end. Much of that was down to the efficiency of the Lions bowlers, who executed their yorkers and slower balls.Bravo took two more wickets off consecutive slower balls in the last over, and could have had his best T20 bowling figures had Sarabjit Ladda pouched a skier off the last ball. Just two boundaries and 36 runs were scored off the last five overs, and Kings XI could muster 161.",4/11/2016,,

sports,Rohit Buttler steer Mumbai to six wicket win over KKR,"KOLKATA: Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No. 4 for Mumbai Indians. It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man. He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket, and deposited it at the midwicket boundary.

sports,RCB crush Sunrisers after hitting 227 4,"BANGALORE: Royal Challengers Bangalore blasted the first 200-plus score of the tournament in an emphatic 45-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In doing so, they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing.AB de Villiers (82) and Virat Kohli (75) provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157-run second-wicket stand, before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma. The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan, who in his typically unorthodox fashion, paddled and reverse-paddled his way to an unbeaten 10-ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4.Deflated and dejected, Sunrisers went for broke, wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs. David Warner, who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20, showed why he is one of the most feared white-ball strikers. He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21-ball half-century before falling into the short-ball trap laid by Watson.The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner, Naman Ojha, Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries, meaning they could only muster 182 for 6. Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers, returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling, even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal, the legspiner, chipped away with two wickets.Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump, was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra, their pace spearhead, hobbled off the field after just 2.1 overs. That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs.The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman, making his IPL debut, troubled them with his cutters. Once the job of seeing off his initial burst - a two-over spell - was done, they let loose. Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44-run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break.Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers, but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back. Adam Milne's second spell, in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket, opened the game up. Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door, it was a simple matter of forcing it open, which they did quite easily. In the end, even Ashish Reddy's big hitting was merely a footnote for Sunrisers in what was a forgettable outing.�",4/13/2016,,

sports,Sharapova could be thrown lifeline by Wada ruling,"NEW YORK: Maria Sharapova and scores of other athletes who have tested positive for meldonium could be handed a lifeline after the World Anti-Doping Agency said there was a lack of scientific evidence about how long the drug stays in the system.Amid growing confusion about the status of an avalanche of positive tests for the drug, which was banned on 1 January this year, Wada said its preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body. In such cases, athletes �could not reasonably have known or suspected� that the drug would still be present in their bodies after 1 January, said WADA in a �clarification paper� to its code signatories on how they should prosecute meldonium cases.�In these circumstances Wada considers that there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,� it added. Sir Craig Reedie, the president of Wada, said: �It is designed to explain the science that we know. The issue that it deals with is the time this drug takes to come out of the system. It�s an attempt to clarify the many questions that we�ve been asked.�The Russian sports ministry and national Olympic committee welcomed the Wada statement, and the country�s officials suggested there could be a mass amnesty of Russian athletes.The head of the Russian tennis federation (RTF), Shamil Tarpishchev, told the R-Sport agency he hoped Sharapova would be able to play at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, while the head of the Russian swimming federation suggested there could be a swift return to competition for the suspended world champion Yulia Efimova.A Wada spokesman said talk of an amnesty was �wide of the mark� and that the document was designed to clarify the position.Sharapova confirmed last month that she had tested positive for meldonium during the Australian Open. She was one of 172 athletes, many of them Russian, to test positive for the drug since it was banned in January.�",4/14/2016,,

I congratulate my players for how they faced the adversity during the game,"" said Enrique.""We still depend on ourselves. Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge.""Now we have a marvellous challenge, five games in which if we win them all we are champions""Barca started brightly, but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves.The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him.However, Valencia amazingly went in at half-time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target.The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first-half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner.Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second-half, but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut-back.However, Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark.Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time.Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi, but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point-blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line.Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on, but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat.In contrast to Barca's collapse, Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada.""It will be tough (to win the league), but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win, win and win again,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone.Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark.Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time.",4/18/2016,,

sports,Delhi beat Bangalore in high scoring IPL encounter,"BANGALORE: Virat Kohli�s 48-ball 79 powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 191 for 5, and AB de Villiers and Shane Watson chipped in with 55 and 33. But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock, who made a bruising 51-ball 108, the first hundred in IPL 2016, to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven-wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.While De Kock starred in the lead role, Karun Nair, who hails from Bangalore, played the supporting role in 134-run third-wicket stand that came off 76 balls.Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets. The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs. Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs.De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball. Once into the home stretch, there was a sense of inevitability to the game. After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson, who had him caught behind, Duminy struck the winning runs, Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease.������������������������������������������������������",4/18/2016,,

Not one of our players who will compete in that test has played test match cricket, or any cricket, with a pink ball.""The reluctance to play is a sign of how much importance the South African players place on the series against Australia,"" Irish added.New Zealand players had similar misgivings about last year�s fixture in Adelaide but were given a A$1 million ($777,000) sweetener by Cricket Australia to commit.Organisers hailed the test a success, despite Australia wrapping up victory in three days.Adelaide tests are traditionally well supported by local fans and interstate visitors but the total attendance of 123,000 was a record in the city for a non-Ashes fixture.Australia, who have also used the pink ball in domestic Sheffield Shield matches, host Pakistan in a three-test series in the coming home summer, with a match at Brisbane�s Gabba ground tipped to be played under lights.Cricket Australia will announce their summer schedule on Wednesday and declined to comment on South Africa�s reservations about the pink ball.",4/19/2016,,

sports,Warners unbeaten 90 powers Sunrisers to first wi,"HYDERABAD: David Warner�s unbeaten 59-ball 90 steered Sunrisers Hyderabad to their first win of the season after their bowlers had kept Mumbai Indians to 142 in conditions that led to a well-matched contest between bat and ball.Southee kept Mumbai in the game with three well-timed wickets, starting with a late-swinging yorker to Shikhar Dhawan, but Mumbai kept feeding Warner a steady supply of release balls, which he put away merrily.He ended the game with two sixes in three balls, flat-batting Mitchell McClenaghan over mid-off and pulling him over deep square leg, and Sunrisers were home with 15 balls remaining. Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches.It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike, though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage. With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning, Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill, and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper.Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball, playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back-of-the-hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left-arm wristspinner's googly. Then came a self-inflicted wound - Rohit, who came in at No. 4, running himself out while looking for a suicidal single. When Jos Buttler, surprised by extra pace from Sran, gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over, they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere.At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu, who had been promoted to No. 3, and Krunal Pandya, who had been promoted to No. 6 ahead of his brother Hardik, who had batted at No. 3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches. All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think-tank, but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities.Moises Henriques and the left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs. But Bipul, who had gone for only 14 off his first three overs, was struck three successive sixes by Krunal in the 14th over.

sports,Kolkata thrash Punjab to go on top in IPL,"MOHALI: Kolkata Knight Riders thrashed Kings XI Punjab by six wickets here on Sunday to go on top of the table in the Indian Premier League 2016.Knight Riders' bowling depth was perceptible as their spinners ripped through Kings XI, in a sub-par batting performance, to keep them to 138 for 8.In the chase, Robin Uthappa's quickfire fifty effectively sealed the game. In 13 games this season, 12 have been won by the chasing team.Put in to bat, Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm, scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla.The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest, but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order.With two left-handers batting - Marsh and Miller - Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season. The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch.Maxwell soon resorted to a switch-hit off Sunil Narine, but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover. Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5.50.In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings, Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over.In between, Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket, on both sides. He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly-timed lofted drive over long-on. Along with Kyle Abbott, he took Andre Russell's first over - the last of the innings - for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138.Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65-run Powerplay, the most productive in this season.The seamers, Sandeep Sharma and Abbott, were inconsistent but when they found their lengths, Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up, on a pitch offering even bounce and carry.Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal, as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu. Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell, running in from deep midwicket.Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan, but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare.",4/20/2016,,

sports,Mumbai Indians outclass RC Bangalor,"MUMBAI: Rohit Sharma�s 44-ball 62 helped Mumbai Indians to overhaul Royal Challengers Bangalore' 170 for seven with 12 balls to spare here at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.His batting was fluid as he took charge of the chase along with Ambati Raid, who was anything but elegant yet equally effective during his 31.The second-wicket stand of 76 in 55 balls laid the platform for Mumbai's chase, before Iqbal Abdulla gave Royal Challengers a new lease of life by dismissing Rayudu and Rohit in quick succession, both to slogs.Mumbai were 109 for three then, needing 62 off seven overs - well on track as dew took effect. Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard, returning from food poisoning, flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them, and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches.Mumbai, who opted to bowl, were staring at a 200-plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59-run stand, before the unheralded players, in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams, rose to the occasion.Krunal Pandya�s twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers. Shane Watson fell not long after, but then Travis Head, on IPL debut, and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7.KL Rahul was put through a short-ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan, during which he was hit hard on the helmet. After the early jitters, though, he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips. Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum.Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball-striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over. Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over.Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase, but Varun Aaron's third over, which went for 19, brought their innings back on track. Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned, a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction. Abdulla's wickets injected a touch of excitement, but any possibility of a close finish was firmly snuffed out by Pollard's charge.",4/21/2016,,

With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.�You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting.<br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, �our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice. They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more. When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself. If you are not answering that question then I don�t think you should be there�, he said.Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist.He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner.Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country.�A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer�, he said.He claimed that it is not like 20 minutes in the gym and 20 minutes in the nets.<br/> �It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough. A lot of guys kid themselves.�They think they are doing enough to be playing for Pakistan and getting great results. I know a lot of time they are not doing enough. Sometimes I wish they could see how world�class players prepare and what it takes.�They watch a lot of cricket but I don�t know if they really digest what they see to get to the top,� he said.

sports,New technology to detect edges in cricket to be launched ,"ISLAMABAD: Paul Hawkins, the inventor of the ball�tracking �Hawk�Eye ball tracking system� has now come up with a bat sensor to pick up nicks perfectly.<br/> The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks.The on-field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored, a prominent sports website www.sportskeeda.com reported.The tiny sensor which costs 25 (AUD46) can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball.Hawkins, who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert, has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon.Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman �stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge.That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket.Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders �the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasn�t given Hawkins was quoted as saying. �More and more batsmen try and get away with it. We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day.�Hawkins technology works much like the real�time Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on-field umpires.�We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didn�t hear is detected,� Hawkins said.�",4/22/2016,,

The decision was given through a referral.Shehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.Shehzad finished the event as the highest scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.Younis promoted left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he attempted a slog sweep.Zohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.Fakhar hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred. He struck three huge sixes and 12 fours in his 111-ball feat. He ended the event as the second highest scorer with 297 runs, which included one century and two fifties.Fakhar added 52 with Younis (49) for the third wicket.Younis and Fahim Ashraf (31) added 57 for the fourth wicket before Ehsan dismissed the latter to leave KP at 265-4 in 44 overs.Fahim struck three fours and a six from 37 balls. Musadiq Ahmed (19) used long handle, hitting two fours and one six in his rapid ten-ball knock.Younis smacked one six from 59 balls before being caught by Shan Masood off Amad as KP lost four wickets off the last 13 balls.Young all-rounder Amad was the pick of the bowlers with 3-55 in ten overs. Ehsan and Aamer Yamin remained expensive with figures of 2-75 in ten overs and 1-49 in six, respectively.Punjab had a poor start when left-arm pacer Zia-ul-Haq removed Salman Butt (0) and Aamer (1) in quick succession to leave them at 29-2 in 7.2 overs.Asad Shafiq (16) also fell early, held excellently by Fakhar at short-cover off the bowling of Fahim. Asad struck three fours from 15 balls.Left-arm spinner Mohammad Asghar got the prized scalp of Shan Masood (36). Asghar tossed it up, it swung in sharply, Shan went on back-foot to cut it, missed it completely before it crashed the stumps. Shan hit five fours from 40 balls. Punjab were gasping at 55-4 in the 13th over.Shoaib (24) and Rizwan (22) tried to consolidate the innings, but at 97, Test-leggie Yasir Shah had the Punjab captain caught by Fahim in the deep. Malik smashed one six and two fours from 26 deliveries.Left-arm spinner Zohaib dislodged Rizwan and Amad (0) in his first over to leave Punjab tottering at 107-7 in the 23rd over.Fahim took his third catch when he held Rizwan at point after the international stumper had smacked two fours from 33 balls. Yasir removed Saif Badar (10).Zulfiqar Babar (29) and Kashif Bhatti (15) extended KP�s wait for celebration as they added 36 for the ninth wicket before Zohaib sent back the former, trapped lbw.Zulfiqar struck two sixes and one four from 32 balls. Yasir completed the rout when he had Ehsan (5) to fold Punjab.Zia-ul-Haq got 2-25 in eight overs.The winners KP received Rs2 million and a glittering trophy, while the runners-up received Rs1 million and runners-up trophy.Besides, Rs100,000 each was handed over to the best all-rounder Zohaib Khan (176 runs, 11 wickets), man of the match Fakhar Zaman, best batsman Ahmed Shehzad (372 runs), best bowlers Mohammad Amir (Sindh) and Zohaib Khan (11 wickets each).KP had brought in Younis Khan and Musadiq Ahmed by dropping Adil Amin and Israrullah.

West Indies retained their eighth-place ranking but lead Bangladesh by only eight points.South Africa and West Indies lost the most points in the update, 17 and 11 respectively. The calculation process dropped results from 2012-13, while outcomes from 2014-15 were weighted at 50%. Only the latest results had 100% weightage. As a result, South Africa's series victories over England, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in 2012-13 were not factored in. They lost series to India and England and drew with Bangladesh in the 2015-16 season. West Indies had beaten New Zealand, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2012-13 but lost to Australia and Sri Lanka in 2015-16.The update favoured Pakistan, because their 2-0 loss to Sri Lanka in August 2014 was weighted at 50%. In terms of points gained, Bangladesh made the most progress, getting ten points, followed by Australia, who gained six.Zimbabwe, ranked No. 10, have 12 points but were not included in the rankings table released by the ICC on Tuesday because they had not completed the required eight Tests in the new rating period.

Australia, which won its fifth World Cup title in Melbourne last year, is now sitting on 124 points after dropping two points to lead New Zealand by 11 points. South Africa has swapped places with India to move into third position.Other sides to gain following the annual update include sixth-ranked England (103, up two), seventh-ranked Bangladesh (98, up one), eighth-ranked West Indies (88, up two), 10th-ranked Afghanistan (51, up four) and 11th-ranked Zimbabwe (47, up two).

sports,Leicester stand to gain up to 250 million pound windf,"strong>Leicester City have the chance of making anything between 150 million pounds and 250 million pounds from their sensational Premier League triumph, according to sports marketing experts.</strongThe city of Leicester in England's Midlands should also expect to enjoy a huge commercial boost after its hometown team wrote the unlikeliest of sporting success stories, one that has captured headlines around the world.Yet though the club known as the Foxes will gain this substantial windfall, they still have a long way to go to join the true big-money elite of world football.The club that had never won the top-flight crown in its history will cash in through the 90 million pounds in prize money from the Premier League, and money from competing in Europe's Champions League next season, as well as increased TV and match day revenue.With Leicester's increasing attraction to sponsors as the champions of the Premier League, which possesses remarkable global appeal, it could all be worth as much as 150 million pounds to the club, said the sports and entertainment intelligence firm, Repucom, on Tuesday.Other experts have put the estimates much higher with some British media reports suggesting that the figure could be much nearer 250 million pounds, particularly if Leicester's success proves to be more than a one-season wonder.Leicester's TV audiences have soared by over 23% globally this season and because of the excitement inspired by their run to the title, audiences in the UK have grown from 785,000 to over one million per game.In Italy, the numbers watching Leicester's games have doubled, largely thanks to the interest generated by the club being managed by Italian coach Claudio Ranieri.""Leicester's media values have jumped by 30 percent globally whilst in the U.S. they have grown by over 70 percent, showing first-hand the increase in value to current and potential sponsors,"" Repucom said.Leicester's first appearance in the lucrative Champions League will also make a vast difference to their coffers in the region of 36 million pounds.As well as increased TV exposure, it will generate increased revenues from group stage fees, a proportion of the competition's market pool and a participation bonus, totalling 33 million pounds, as well as 3 million pounds performance bonus.A story which had echoes of Leicester's triumph was Atletico Madrid's breaking of the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly to win La Liga in 2014.Based on the increased match day and commercial revenues that unlikely champions Atletico gleaned, Leicester can expect to see between 10 to 15 million pounds boost in that area.""Leicester City FC's real commercial potential will become clearer in the season break as brands vie to associate themselves to the club,"" Spencer Nolan, head of consulting at Repucom, said.So, much will depend, in the mid to long-term on how successful the club, owned by Thailand billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, are in developing their fan base.Though their victory was greeted enthusiastically in Thailand, where Srivaddhanaprabha's family runs the duty-free empire King Power, their fan base is still not in the same league as the historic elite of the English game like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.Meanwhile, Leicester itself hopes for an economic boon, with the local newspaper, Leicester Mercury, reporting that financial experts believe the overall economy in the city could benefit to the tune of 49 million pounds.The numbers of visitors to the city have grown rapidly since the discovery of the remains of King Richard III in 2012 and now tourism chiefs hope that being the home of England's football champions will prove a draw card for Leicester too.",5/4/2016,,

Bidders who did not meet ""technical requirements"" would be excluded, it said.Infantino was elected as FIFA president in February when one of his main promises was to increase the number of teams in the finals from 32 to 40, a proposal which is strongly opposed by Europe's biggest clubs.FIFA said that decisions were expected by October on the number of teams, the format for the tournament, the ""eligibility of (continental) confederations to bid"" and whether to allow joint bids.Joint bids were banned in 2011 but Infantino has said he wants to encourage them, possibly spreading the tournament around several countries in a region.strong>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</strongFIFA said that a ""consultation process"", outlining new standards for bidders, would run until May 2017, followed by a preparation phase running until December 2018 when countries would have to submit their bids.The bids would be evaluated from January 2019 to February 2020 with a final decision three months later.FIFA was forced to reform its bidding process after the vote in December 2010 awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.That vote is the subject of a criminal investigation by Swiss authorities, while Qatar's preparations have also been marred by allegations of abuse of migrant workers in the construction industry. Qatar says it is working to solve the issue.Under revised statutes, the hosts will be chosen by the 209 members of FIFA at its annual Congress. The Council, however, will still draw up a shortlist of three candidates. Previously, hosting rights were decided by the old executive committee.FIFA said that Gibraltar and Kosovo's applications for membership would be submitted to the Congress on Friday and that both would be allowed to take part in the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition if accepted.Benin was suspended with immediate effect due to legal interference in the country's football federation. A decision not to suspend Greece was ratified by the Council.FIFA Council member Fernando Sarney praised Infantino's leadership on Tuesday.""Things are getting calmer in FIFA,"" the Brazilian representative told reporters.""Gianni is talking about football, he is travelling around, talking to people and trying to put football back into our conversations because before we talked about everything apart from football.""",5/11/2016,,

Players fielding close to the stumps, excluding slips fieldsmen, should also wear helmets, the report said.The report noted that more international players had adopted the use of stem guards, which are attached across the back of the helmet, as ""they see it providing additional safety"".""I would recommend that this device be properly evaluated for functionality and comfort as well as to determine if it materially increases player safety, before making any recommendation as to its use,"" it said.Cricket Australia (CA) said it had received the Curtain review last year and would enact new safety measures.<br/>""The global cricket community was deeply saddened by the tragic death of Phillip Hughes and the great loss his family suffered,"" CA CEO James Sutherland said.""We have been considering (Curtain�s) recommendations and discussing with relevant bodies as to how we best make changes necessary to prevent an accident of this nature happening again.""While there will always be a small risk we believe that the measures we have already taken and will enact following this review will reduce that risk even further.",5/11/2016,,

Wearing only shorts and a t-shirt, the 22-year-old draws crowds in a country where Muslim mores mean women�s boxing is a rare spectacle.""When I train, more spectators watch because women�s boxing is new and unfamiliar in Sudan,"" Abkar said proudly at the private Nile Club in the south of the city.Sudan is ruled by Islamic law, which requires women to dress modestly. Most families are not so supportive and another girl at the club said she boxed in secret as her family would object to her taking part in what they see as a man�s sport.Women�s boxing was unheard of in Sudan until four years ago, when Sahar Mohamed took up the sport and represented her country at the All Africa Games last year. She was defeated on points in the Middleweight category by Yannick Azangue of Cameroon.Since then, the Sudan Amateur Boxing Federation has sought to encourage women to join the sport despite social challenges.""Four years ago, I was the first Sudanese girl to box and I faced big pressures from my family and people but I�ll continue as this is my life�s dream,"" said Mohamed at a state-run youth centre in Khartoum, where she trains.Nearby, two women were training alongside men, shouting as they jumped from foot to foot and punched each other with worn gloves. The equipment is worn and basic, but the centre is busy, the atmosphere buzzing with young people practicing everything from martial arts to soccer.""People watch satellite channels and look on the internet and that has changed the culture and given new courage to women in the past few years to pick up boxing gloves,"" Mohamed Yousef, head of the Sudanese national boxing team, said.""The Sudan Boxing Federation asked us put more emphasis on girls to encourage them to continue in the sport.

sports,Lack of international games denting Pakistan cricket says Arthur,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's newly appointed coach Mickey Arthur feels that dearth of international cricket at home has damaged Pakistan cricket and termed it as one of the reasons behind Pakistan�s decline in the game.The former Australia and South Africa coach said that Pakistani batsmen will have to play an important role to achieve results for the team.�Pakistan is playing all the cricket outside the country. Every time they play it is an away series which is really hard. It is always difficult playing outside your condition and it has dented Pakistan cricket�, in an exclusive interview with a private news channel Arthur said.The South African-born coach said that he picked up the role of coaching Pakistan team considering it as a big challenge and that he was looking forward to deliver results but demanded consistency in team decisions for any positive outcome.�I think it�s a great challenge. Pakistan cricket has struggled a little bit in the last couple of years and certainly I am keen to bring it back to its rightful place in the ranking and the rightful place in world cricket�, he said.Talking about his first assignment with Pakistan team, the tour of England, Arthur said that the series will be a big challenge for the players and key will be to learn how to perform outside the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan has been playing most of its cricket recently.�Pakistan has got a wonderful group of bowlers. We need to work on batting, particularly outside the UAE, and that will be key. Also we need to bring the fielding up to standards of international level,� he added.�It will be a challenge for players that how they are going to handle the conditions outside the UAE and Pakistan. You need your batsmen to step up and score runs.<br/> So technically we need to work really hard to get our batting 100 percent right�, said 47-year-old former cricketer.During Arthur�s coaching stint, South Africa reached the top in all the three formats.Arthur said he is confident that Pakistan can also achieve the top position but warned that it can be achieved only if there is consistency in team decisions.<br/> �You need opportunity and time to build the team in order to achieve the result.<br/> We need to be consistent with our selections, we need to be consistent with our players and we need to allow players to express themselves without any consequences.�That�s the key, players need to find out how they go about and play in certain situations. I hope we can give the players that experience and make sure they go forward�, he said.Arthur said he did not feel any language barrier while working with Pakistani players during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year, where he coached the team Karachi Kings but added that he would still look to have a local coach as his assistant so that his message is not lost in translation.�I will have a local coach as my assistant who can deliver my message to the guys.<br/> That is quite important. But language barrier wasn�t a problem in PSL and I hope it won�t be a problem while coaching Pakistan as well�, he said.Sharing his PSL experience Arthur said that his experience of working with Pakistani players was excellent as they pose immense talent.�I was very impressed with the talent in the PSL. There were very good young and useful players. I think with the right guidance and environment, these guys can become very very good players.Their skill level is very high�, he said.Arthur, who is currently in Perth, said he will join the Pakistan team by the end of this month.�",5/13/2016,,

The guests of world soccer are more likely to be inside sipping lattes for eight times the price.FIFA has often been known for lavishing a five-star lifestyle on its delegates and officials. When former president Sepp Blatter went to an event in Zurich with the city's mayor, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine while the politician came and went by tram.But after Gianni Infantino was elected president of soccer's scandal-plagued body in February, one of his first pledges was to make FIFA more humble, suggesting, among other things, that federation officials no longer wore suits to matches.The early signs were promising as he flew to Britain for his first official engagement by a budget airline rather than the private plane favoured by his predecessor.But this week's Congress in Mexico City has looked as extravagant as any held under Blatter.FIFA confirmed that it paid all the expenses for each of its 209 member associations to bring a three-man delegation, flying business class and staying in five-star accommodation. Each delegate was also given $1,000 in spending money.LEAVE THE BUBBLERooms at the Presidente are booked for about $400 a night. Members of the FIFA Council, the world governing body's board, are staying at the plusher Four Seasons hotel where rooms typically cost $675 a night, according to hotel booking websites.FIFA sources told Reuters that efforts were being made to persuade delegates to leave their bubble but having them walk a few hundred yards took some effort.Some were seen walking the 500 metres from their hotel to Thursday's opening ceremony at the city's 10,000-seat National Auditorium, considered one of the world's best entertainment venues.It was seen by FIFA as a step, albeit it a small one, in the right direction, although others insisted on taking a luxury bus.The night before, FIFA seemed as detached as ever when their so-called Legends team of former international footballers took part in an exhibition match at Mexico City's historic Azteca stadium.FIFA billed it as a ""football fiesta"" and said it was ""engaging more with the football world and getting football back to the heart of FIFA,� It was closed to the public.It was witnessed only by specially invited guests who spent most of the evening in a tent built onto the pitch, where they were pampered with wine, champagne and canapes, while traditional Mexican dances were performed on a stage.Privately, FIFA sources said the event had been hastily arranged and had not been what they intended.Infantino, who has vowed to cut costs, was somewhat vague when asked about it at a media conference on Friday, though he said it was something FIFA could look into.""I think it's always been the case that they are paid $1,000 as a fee for the delegates, it's part of the budget approved by the finance committee,"" he said.""It's good that it's been raised and we might have a look at it.""",5/14/2016,,

sports,ICC opens talks with broadcasters to hold two extra World T20,"DUBAI: The ICC has opened discussions with broadcasters about organising World Twenty20 tournaments in 2018 and 2022, thus the event will be played every two years.This means two extra World Cups will be added to the existing schedule as it looks to cash in on the booming popularity of the game�s shortest format.After the success of the World Twenty20 in India recently, the ICC does not want to wait another four years for the next tournament, which is due to be staged in Australia in 2020.This was proposed at the ICC recent board meeting in Dubai about holding a World Twenty20 every two years with West Indies a possibility for the proposed 2018 tournament and the UAE in 2022. The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICC�s annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion.An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2?billion (�1.4?billion) rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023. That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments (the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World Twenty20) on a four year cycle.But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League, which featured domestic teams from around the world, has left a hole in the calendar in September-October, a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations.Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the men�s World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018, possibly as a run in or at the same as the women�s version is due to take place in the Caribbean. But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market, where the vast broadcast deals are on offer.Another possibility is South Africa, although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas. The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India. England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup.The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings. The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83?million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2.45?million viewers, the channel�s highest rating for a cricket match.Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5.75?billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46?million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook. �It is a fact that the ICC World Twenty20 2016 engaged with fans, old and new, like never before,� said Dave Richardson, the ICC�s chief executive.�",5/15/2016,,

sports,Hales Bairstow rescue England with 88 run unbeaten stand,"LEEDS: A diligent half-century from Alex Hales, coupled with some home-ground know-how from Jonny Bairstow, helped England to regroup with a 88-run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka, after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break.By tea, Hales was unbeaten on 71, his second Test half-century in nine innings and his highest yet, beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January.At the other end was Bairstow, who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5, but responded with the sort of sparky counter-punching. Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.",5/19/2016,,
sports,Sri Lankas Shanaka debut triple stings England,"LEEDS: Alastair Cook�s bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley, as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much-heralded top order.By lunch, Cook had been dismissed for 16 - still 20 runs shy of his landmark - with Nick Compton and Joe Root, the local hero and newly-crowned England Test player of the year, both following for ducks in a sensational ten-minute spell before lunch.It was left to Alex Hales, who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour, and England's own debutant, James Vince, to glue the innings together. Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence, as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline - and a definite bout of indigestion - of 57 for 3.Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new-ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep.Instead, having launched his Test career with a maiden, Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off, and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper.Then, three balls later, Compton poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip.Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium-pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead.It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler, Dushmantha Chameera, as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner, Rangana Herath, whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break.Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka.�",5/19/2016,,

sports,Chinese magnate to buy English soccer team Aston Vi,"A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa, the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport.The deal, reportedly worth 60 million pounds ($88 million), will see the chairman of little-known Recon Group, Xia Jiantong, become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team.Under the leadership of Xi, an avid fan, China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup, and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies, television rights, transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad.More broadly, Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan ($782 billion) by 2025, about five times its current scale.China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year, when a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival, Manchester City.The Villa deal, however, with 100 percent ownership, is not just an investment.""The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.Crosstown arch-rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia, following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung.Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who put the club on the market in 2014, struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league.Recon Group, Xia's privately owned holding company, owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges.The deal with American-educated Xia, 39, ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner, who bought the midlands club for 62.2 million pounds in 2006. Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa, who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top-flight title seven times.The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table, with only half the number of points of the next worst team.""Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour,"" said Fredrik van Huynh, Shanghai-based director of HHC Sports Group. ""It will have pushed down the price quite significantly.""Xia, who studied at Harvard University and has a doctorate, took to his official microblog late on Wednesday to wish the club's fans ""health and happiness"".Earlier this month he posted: ""Go, Villa, Go! We will be back.""The club said Xia's immediate objective was ""to return Aston Villa to the Premier League and then to have the club finish in the top six, bringing European football back to Villa Park"".It added the deal would also help make Villa the most famous football club in China.Dreyer at China Sports Insider dismissed that as ""simply ludicrous"", given the appeal of much bigger rivals such as Spain's Barcelona and England's Manchester United and Arsenal.""I think fans of the club will remain sceptical until it becomes clear what his true motivations are,"" he added.($1 = 0.6837 pounds)",5/19/2016,,
sports,Canny Sevilla retain iron grip on Europa League trophy,"Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday, flooring Liverpool with a 3-1 victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe's second-tier competition.Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel's St Jakob-Park having been the architect of their heroics, scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge's opener.It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp's side should have been home and dry, but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling.Unai Emery's team hit back with three goals in 25 minutes, the first coming just 17 seconds after the interval, to claim the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons and become the first side in 40 years to win three consecutive European competitions.""At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it,"" Emery said. ""It is our competition and we underlined that once again.""For Liverpool and Klopp, who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February's League Cup disappointment, it was a dispiriting occasion.His team's hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed, leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition.""The players are still young,"" Klopp told reporters. ""We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC.""It had looked, however, like being an entirely different outcome at the interval.The opening goal arrived after 35 minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge, who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin-point curling finish off the outside of his left boot.The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents.The halftime whistle came to Sevilla's rescue, however, allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch.Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno, whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season, darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira, who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side-foot into an empty net.Then it was Liverpool's turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after 63 minutes.Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner.The final nail in Liverpool's coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet, only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again.After some pushing and shoving the goal stood, leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb.Having retreated so far into their shell, however, they were incapable of rising above base camp.",5/19/2016,,
sports,Sri Lanka skittled out for 91 in reply to Englands 298,"LEEDS: The England pace attack ripped out Sri Lanka for 91 after Jonny Bairstow made an excellent century to put the hosts in complete control of the first Test on the second day in Leeds on Friday.Bairstow�s superb knock of 140 lifted England to 298 in their first innings before James Anderson and Stuart Broad took nine wickets between them in favourable conditions for seam bowling at Headingley.England captain Alastair Cook enforced the follow-on and the touring side negotiated two deliveries to reach one for no wicket before bad light ended play. Sri Lanka trail by 206 runs in the opening match of the three-Test series.England had resumed in the morning on 171 for five and Bairstow and Alex Hales extended their sixth-wicket partnership to 141. Hales, on 86, was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover.Moeen Ali (nought) and Broad (two) were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow, dropped on 70, completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground.Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn, the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid-on off Chameera.Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly.Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow, leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three.Dinesh Chandimal, on 15, was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow.Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one, Chameera (2) drove Broad to Finn at mid-off and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 22, was caught by Finn at mid-on off Broad.Anderson completed his 19th five-wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg-side.�",5/20/2016,,
sports,England strike against Sri Lanka after Bairstow century,"LEEDS: England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played �a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.",5/20/2016,,
sports,Bairstow hits century as England continue fightb,"LEEDS: Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion.

sports,Sri Lanka Pakistan will face England under a new for,"ISLAMABAD: �England and Wales Cricket Board (EWCB) director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer.The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday.As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests one�day internationals and one�off Twenty20internationals against both tourists.But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win, two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the white�ball matches www.skysports.com reported.An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty20 matches in the case of this summer�s tours and an unsponsored prize of 25,000 will be put up by the home board. The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.�Today I�m introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats�, �said the former England captain.�The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.�Two separate white�ball teams and a red�ball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesn�t do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.�The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.�If the same points formula had been applied to England�s winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line. Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect,� said Strauss.�If you look at the last two series we played � against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20. Anyone out there who doesn�t see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand.�I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and we�ve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12-18 months but there are some worrying signs there,� so let�s act before it�s too late�.",5/20/2016,,

He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage.""Van Gaal, though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club, was not so happy to be moving on.""I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan,"" he said.""It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC, and in doing so, I have fulfilled a long-held ambition.""I have been privileged during my management career to have won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.""That success, however, could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings, missing out on Champions League qualification, and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories.�<strong>DISGRUNTLED FANS</strongAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago, Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season.However, United's inability to produce the free-flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson's trophy-laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands.For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football, Van Gaal's stultifying approach was hard to swallow, particularly when it did not work well, after he spent almost 300 million pounds ($434.34 million) on players.This season's dire statistics, beyond the key one of fifth place, are a damning indictment of the Dutchman's tactics.United scored 49 goals in 38 games, in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over 76 and fourth-placed Manchester City's 71.They had the joint-highest number of goalless draws in the division, while Opta noted that United's 430 shots on target was 15th in the 20-team league and they made more backward passes than any other side.It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either.A story in Monday's Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman's rigid tactical directions, which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first-time shots.It also reported that the two most senior players, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post-match ""evaluation sessions"" in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team mates�<strong>WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION</strongWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the 64-year-old former Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May 2014 following Moyes's sacking.He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth-place finish but, despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger, United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September.French striker Martial apart, the new players struggled to justify their fees, and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford, who has rapidly emerged from United's youth team to earn a place in the England squad.By mid-December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven.At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters, already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League, chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal's side were in a 2-1 loss to FC Midjytlland.Despite recovering with a 5-1 win in the second leg, United then lost to Liverpool in the round of 16.A late challenge for fourth place, the Cup run and the fan-pleasing introduction of the youngsters, bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood.Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho, once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms.The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of success across Europe, combined with a larger-than-life personality, mean that, if he is appointed, United fans will at least be able to look forward to next season rather than dreading it.",5/24/2016,,

sports,Mourinho agrees terms with Man United Sky TV,"strong>English football's biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport's most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho, according to Sky TV reports, agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday.</strongAfter a trophy-laden career with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday, with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson.The 53-year-old, sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells, had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in 12 years when they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after extra-time in Saturday's Wembley final.Van Gaal's preferred possession-dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast, direct attacking, was widely criticised, and it appeared to take his players time to adapt.Mourinho is also known for pragmatism, however, relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard-working midfielders and strikers.He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game.Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top-flight title in 50 years in his first campaign, retaining it the following season.He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup.Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea, he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor -- and troubled -- start to the 2015-16 season led to his sacking.�<strong>DIVIDED OPINION</strongHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford, touted in the media for months, will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes, he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be.The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style.Van Gaal's FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club's fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety-first football being served up.Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal.There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore, something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs.However, after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years, the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the 'Special One' gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport's top table.Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese ""could save"" the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce, who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence, said the chance to bring in Mourinho was ""too good to miss"".Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who will coach Bayern Munich next season, said Mourinho would be a ""fantastic signing"", adding United had ""lost its identity this last year"".Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona, however, said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead, saying he ""loved"" Mourinho but that his style of play is ""not Manchester United"".Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is ""similar"" to Van Gaal in being a ""workaholic"" who ""prepares perfectly on how to win"".De Boer, who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona, said of Mourinho: ""Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins.

sports,Exclusive Brazil investigating possible corruption at Olympic venu,"strong>Brazilian investigators have expanded their probe into possible corruption around the staging of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this August to include all the venues and services financed with federal funds, a lead prosecutor told Reuters.</strongFederal investigations have previously focused on ""legacy"" modernization projects not directly tied to the Games but this newly disclosed probe includes Olympic Park and the Deodoro area where Olympic venues are located, federal prosecutor Leandro Mitidieri said.""It's not just the physical works we're looking at - it is contracts for services, security, everything that used federal funds,"" he told Reuters from his Rio de Janeiro office late on Tuesday.The Olympics were meant to showcase Brazil's rise as a global power. Instead, they will take place as suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial, the economy suffers its worst recession since the 1930s, an outbreak of the Zika virus prompts health concerns and a massive corruption scandal infuriates Brazilians.Mitidieri said his team is also investigating what happened to federal funds earmarked for cleaning Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing events will take place, and lakes that surround the main Olympic venues in western Rio's Barra neighborhood.Those bodies of water have heavy sewage contamination and remain badly polluted despite promises to drastically improve them as a legacy achievement of the Olympics.Another team of federal prosecutors, along with federal police, is investigating whether the Rio de Janeiro state water utility company Cedae committed environmental crimes by not properly treating sewage in Rio's metropolitan area of 12 million people, Mitidieri said.Rio utility Cedae said it had not been notified about the investigation and could not make a comment without understanding more about the probe.Mitidieri would not say if his team had uncovered any proof of corruption - but he added that detailed announcements about the investigation's results would be made in coming weeks.Five construction firms are building most of the 39 billion reais ($10.8 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for Rio's Olympics. The figure includes at least 1.76 billion reais in federal funds, according to documents from Brazil's federal accounting court.All five companies are caught up in an investigation into price fixing and kickbacks at state-run oil company Petrobras, a two-year probe that has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed, charged or under investigation.The Petrobras (PETR4.SA) investigation is what led federal police and prosecutors to begin looking at possible corruption tied to the Olympics.Federal authorities have already said they are investigating the Porto Maravilha project, an 8 billion real facelift of Rio's dilapidated port area, and also the expansion of the city's metro line to the Olympic area in Barra.Court files made public in March showed police uncovered documents from executives of Latin America's largest construction firm, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], that referenced 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to those two big legacy projects.Odebrecht is at the center of the Petrobras scandal and is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.A spokeswoman for Odebrecht said by email that the company had no comment to make.Mitidieri declined to provide details on which companies are the focus of the federal probe, though he did note that OAS SA [OAS.UL] and Queiroz Galvao had ""a lot of activity"" in the Deodoro region of the Olympics. OAS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvao wrote in an email that the company had not been notified about the investigation and had no further comment.Rio de Janeiro's city government oversees most Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government. The city government says contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators.Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating, and has a budget of 7 billion reais.The federal government, Mitidieri noted, is by law responsible for any debts the local organizing committee may incur.The Rio 2016 local organizing committee referred questions to the mayor's office.The mayor's office said it would not comment without knowing what exact contracts were under investigation.

I'll be at 100 per cent. On Saturday, I'll be in better form than I was in Lisbon,"" Ronaldo told Spanish television channel La Sexta.""In Lisbon, my hamstring was hurting me. It was pretty bad. It was terrible because you know that in certain moments you could give more but you can't because your body doesn't respond.""Ronaldo has scored -- and been on the winning side -- in both the Champions League finals he has played in, having also won in 2008 with Manchester United.He is top scorer in this season's tournament with 16 goals and is one strike away from equalling the record tally of 17 he set in 2013/14.Real's all-time top scorer also gave the club a lift before the final by declaring he wants to stay at Real for the long term.""Real Madrid would be making a smart decision if they offered me a new contract,"" he added.Zinedine Zidane's men are without defenders Raphael Varane and Alvaro Arbeloa for the game, while Atletico have a clean bill of health.It's a far cry from the dishevelled state in which Diego Simeone's team arrived at the 2014 final, when they struggled with fitness after a long season and suffered key injuries.On their way to that Madrid showdown Atletico won 1-0 at the San Siro. Real, on the other hand, have never won a competitive game at the stadium in 13 attempts.Defender Diego Godin says Atletico are in better shape than last time around, and thinks his side's team ethic, instilled into them by the charismatic Simeone, could prove key to winning their first European Cup.Godin told Uefa.com: �Our big secret is the effort the team puts in. The way the whole team works to help the defence is incredible.""The forwards � Fernando Torres, Antoine Griezmann or Yannick Carrasco � are always with us, defending in our box.""That shows how committed we are as a team, and how much we believe in our style of play.�",5/26/2016,,

England�s bowlers could not have had a better platform to launch their attack than Moeen�s 207-ball innings, which was his best in tests and his second century against Sri Lanka.At times watchful and then belligerent, Moeen became only the fifth England number seven to reach three figures in tests after being promoted one place in the order to cover for the injured Ben Stokes.The Worcestershire all-rounder moved on from his overnight 28 and made the most of the three lives the tourists gave him on Saturday.Support came from Woakes, who shared a stand of 92, and Steven Finn, who scored just 10 of their ninth-wicket stand of 72. His wicket provided spinner Rangana Herath with momentary cause for celebration as he became only the third Sri Lankan bowler to take 300 test wickets.Moeen reached his 150 with a huge six before Cook declared midway through the second session.

Jose and Pep Guardiola up in Manchester, Conte coming to Chelsea,"" the defender added.""There's real fight amongst the managers who'll be eager to start well so I think it will be interesting times.""United midfielder Michael Carrick has urged Mourinho to prioritise results over an attractive style of play despite British media reporting Van Gaal lost his job because of his side's poor quality of football during his two-year reign.""There is going to be change, without doubt. He is coming in and he is his own man, he's got an unbelievable track record. I know there is a lot of talk about styles, but it is about winning,"" Carrick told British media.""You have to be number one, you have to be winning trophies, and if you can do that with a bit of style and a bit of flair then obviously that's the perfect match but, first and foremost, it is about winning and getting back on top.""United missed out on Champions League qualification for the second time in the last three seasons after they finished fifth in the table.

sports,Dont call Warney Australia prospect Z,"strong>MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.</strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.""There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,"" Zampa told Australian media.""The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.""People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.""strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.""The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,"" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.",5/30/2016,,

He also developed some problems in his right ankle which is creating a problem for his landing after completing a delivery,"" he said.""He needs some rest to remove the stress. If he continues like this he may collapse any time. We need to assess him carefully to see how long he needs to stay away from cricket,"" he added.Rahman missed two Twenty20 internationals against Zimbabwe in January for a shoulder injury, which also kept him sidelined for the first edition of the Pakistan Super League in the United Arab Emirates.He returned home for the Asia Cup but picked up a rib injury during a match against Sri Lanka to miss the final and then four matches in the subsequent ICC World Twenty20 in India.Fans gave Rahman a warm reception on Monday after his successful stint in the IPL made headlines at home.A deputy minister called him a ""national hero"" as he and hundreds of fans received him at the airport with a crown of red roses.",6/2/2016,,

She will next face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva.In the bottom half of the men's draw, Andy Murray doused some early fireworks from Frenchman Richard Gasquet to win 5-7 7-6(3) 6-0 6-2 to set up a blockbuster semi-final against holder Stan Wawrinka. The Swiss beat Albert Ramos (Spain) 6-2 6-1 7-6(7).�<strong>RAIN PLAY STILL A HOT TOPIC</strongBut the hot topic of the day remained what the organisers did, or did not do, on Tuesday.Djokovic's victim Bautista Agut said officials had ""pushed us to play two hours yesterday"" -- the threshold needed to avoid reimbursing money to ticket-holders -- while Venus Williams labelled the conditions ""really bad"" after being ambushed 6-2 6-4 by Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky.""The conditions were not playable yesterday. It's hard to see. The balls are wet, the courts are wet,"" said the American, whose defeat ended hopes of an all-Williams semi-final.French Open director Guy Forget defended the tournament's actions.""I understand that not refunding spectators .... has caused frustration and anger,"" he said.""If what we are being accused of were true, it would have been in our best interests to stop play before the one-hour, 59-minute mark as our insurer would have been responsible for ticket reimbursement.""However... our aim was to play for as long as possible, even if that meant being criticised for playing in difficult conditions.""Djokovic will be hoping he does not face another soggy day on Thursday when he is scheduled to contest his 28th successive major quarter-final against Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych, a 6-3 7-5 6-3 winner over 2013 runner-up David Ferrer.Austrian tyro Dominic Thiem was enjoying his most successful run at a grand slam after beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-7(2) 6-1 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with Belgian David Goffin.Venus Williams' eighth-seeded conqueror Bacsinszky, describing herself as ""a chameleon"" who can adapt to ""every type of court"", will next face Dutch outsider Kiki Bertens who downed American 15th seed Madison Keys 7-6(4) 6-3.Already in the semi-finals though are Spanish fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur.Fourth seed Muguruza ended the run of 108th-ranked American Shelby Rogers with a 7-5 6-3 win, while 2010 Paris finalist Stosur beat Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4 7-6(6).",6/2/2016,,

It's fantastic for the tournament because it gives it a massive kick.""It is the fifth tournament in succession where Pakistan and India are scheduled to meet in the group stage. Matches between the two countries attract huge television audiences, sometimes up to one billion. It had long been suspected that the ICC was doctoring draws to guarantee fans and broadcasters regular opportunities to savour cricket's most lucrative fixture, but this is the first time that the governing body has admitted it publicly.Richardson denied that the 'tweaking' impacted the integrity of any tournament. ""What we try and do is make sure that when you add up the rankings of the different groups, they all add up to the same number of points. You can do that in a number of ways. So long as the pools are balanced, it's silly to avoid [the fixture] when you can fairly cater for it,"" he said.",6/2/2016,,

sports,ICC calls clampdown bat siz,"strong>LONDON: India�s Anil Kumble and several other former Test players on an International Cricket Council committee have urged the sport�s law-makers to bring in new restrictions on the size of bats amid concerns over a glut of run-scoring.</strongFollowing a two-day meeting at Lord�s, the headquarters of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the ICC cricket committee chaired by Kumble issued a statement saying it wanted MCC, which still has overall global responsibility for cricket�s Laws or rules, to instigate a clampdown.While there are limitations on bat length (when the lower portion of the handle is inserted it shall not be more than 38in/96.5cm) and width (4.25in/10.8cm at its widest part), none currently exist on depth.Modern manufacturers have become increasingly skilled at making bats with larger �sweet spots� that do not feel as heavy to pick-up as the blades that were once only the preserve of 1980s power-hitters such as West Indies great Clive Lloyd and England hero Ian Botham.The balance between bat and ball has become especially loaded against bowlers in limited overs games where the innovations brought in by Twenty20 cricket, allied to increasingly short boundaries, have led to an orgy of run-scoring.Last year�s 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand witnessed 38 hundreds, nearly one every game, and 463 sixes, an average of one every nine overs.West Indies� Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes in racing to the fastest one-day international double hundred during a World Cup match against Zimbabwe at Canberra�s Manuka Oval, while New Zealand�s Martin Guptill hit a six measured at 110 metres in the course of his 237 against the West Indies at Wellington.Thursday�s statement from the ICC cricket committee, whose members include several former Test batsmen in England�s Andrew Strauss, India�s Rahul Dravid and Sri Lanka�s Mahela Jayawardene, said: ""MCC sought the committee�s guidance on the desirability of making changes in order to redress the balance between bat and ball.""The committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger �sweet-spots�.""It added: ""The committee�s view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball.""South Africa batting great Barry Richards, speaking during last year�s World Cup, said restrictions were urgently needed to bring modern-day bats into line with the kind of relatively slim models he used in his 1970s heyday.""The pressing of cricket bats has to be controlled and the thickness in their edges. Maybe there can also be a designated sweet-spot area for bats,"" Richards told the Sydney Daily Telegraph.""Ours used to be about the size of a 50 cent piece but now they are much bigger...

Today Garbine played unbelievable.""It�s definitely something I want to dissect and see what I can learn from that and what can I do to get better from it.""<br/>Williams had struggled with an adductor injury at Roland Garros, a condition not helped by the unseasonal chill and damp.Despite that, she still finished top of the pile for aces served at 36 and sent down the joint fastest serve of the event at 196km/h in Saturday�s final.But she had one of the lowest first serve percentage rates at 60% and managed to convert only 30 of 73 break points over the two weeks.The final, she suggested, was a reflection of her tournament as a whole.""It was just so many holes. Like I could have served better. I mean, I made a lot of errors on my return.""I did definitely try out there today, but did I play better than the other matches? It�s a totally different game. But it�s going in the right direction, I think.""Williams believes Muguruza, the first Spanish woman since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998 to win a Grand Slam, has the game to build further on her Roland Garros breakthrough.""I think she has a bright future, obviously. She knows how to play on the big stage and she clearly knows how to win Grand Slams,"" said the American of a player who was just eight when she won her first Paris title.""She�s definitely hitting hard.

But he moved like a lightweight. So he floated like a butterfly and he did sting like a bee because his shots were fast, powerful and explosive.

sports,Boxing legend Muhammad Ali dies US,"LOS ANGELES: Boxing icon Muhammad Ali died on Friday, a family spokesman said in a statement.""After a 32-year battle with Parkinson�s disease, Muhammad Ali has passed away at the age of 74,"" spokesman Bob Gunnell said.Ali, whose fame transcended sport during a remarkable heavyweight boxing career that spanned three decades, had been hospitalized in the Phoenix, Arizona, area with a respiratory ailment this week.Born in Louisville, Ky., in 1942, as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., he began boxing at the age of 12, winning a number of amateur titles, culminating in an Olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at the 1960 Games in Tokyo. He turned pro soon after that.Early in his career, he battled societal norms as frequently as he did his opponents. In 1964, as the struggle for civil rights simmered, he knocked out heavy favorite Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title for the first time, then told reporters that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and had changed his name to Muhammad Ali, a name many news outlets at the time were slow to recognize.By 1967, he had successfully defended the title nine times, all but two by knockout. With the Vietnam War raging, he refused induction into the U.S. Army, on religious grounds, and was arrested and charged with draft evasion. When prodded further for his reasons for resisting, he said, �I am not going 10,000 miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slave-masters over dark people the world over.�Though he remained free on appeal, he was stripped of his title and not allowed to box for more than three years. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, unanimously, in 1971. (A 2013 film by Stephen Frears, �Muhammad Ali�s Greatest Fight,� which dramatized the court�s decision, debuted in Cannes, aired on HBO in the U.S., and earned an Emmy nomination.)During his exile from the ring, Ali decided to try acting, starring in the 1969 Broadway musical �Buck White� at the George Abbott Theatre. He played a militant black lecturer, and got better reviews than the show, which closed after seven performances. �He sings with a pleasant slightly impersonal voice, acts without embarrassment and moves with innate dignity,� wrote New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes.Ali�s boxing career was defined by his matches against top opponents, particularly rivals Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His 1971 bout with Frazier to unify the heavyweight championship, his third after being reinstated, was called the Fight of the Century. Among those in attendance at Madison Square Garden were Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, and Sammy Davis Jr. Bert Lancaster was the color commentator for the closed-circuit TV feed. Life Magazine hired Frank Sinatra as the photographer for Norman Mailer�s story.Ali had exploded the era of humble sports heroes when he declared, �I am the greatest!� in the run-up to his title fight with Liston. He also was among the first athletes to trash-talk his opponents, and he called Frazier, who supported the war, an Uncle Tom. Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round, and won a unanimous decision.Ali had to wait three years for another shot at the championship, this time against Foreman, who had beaten Frazier so badly in taking the title that few gave the 32-year-old challenger a chance against the 25-year-old champ. Ali called the fight, held in Kinshasa, Zaire, the Rumble in the Jungle. In documenting the bout 22 years later, Gast�s Oscar-winning �When We Were Kings� showed how an ebullient Ali had arrived on the scene a few days before the taciturn Foreman, and won over the nation�s citizens. An impromptu entourage of hundreds followed him around chanting, �Ali, bomaye!� (Ali, kill him!).In 1977, Ali lent his name to a short-lived NBC animated series �I Am the Greatest!: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali.� Somewhat more memorably that year, he joined Sylvester Stallone � whose �Rocky� was to win best picture � to present the best supporting actress award to Beatrice Straight for her role in �Network.�In the ring, a third, brutal fight against Frazier (the �Thrilla in Manilla�) as well as battles with Ken Norton subjected Ali to a great deal of punishment. And though he would become the first heavyweight to reclaim the title for a third time in 1978 at age 36, when he beat 25-year-old Leon Spinks in a rematch, the wear and tear of a career in boxing was apparent.He retired, and stayed that way for two years, but ill-advisedly returned for two more bouts, with Larry Holmes and Trevor Burbick, both cringe-inducing losses.In 1996, 12 years after his Parkinson�s diagnosis, Ali, showing the effects of the disease, lit the torch to begin the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In 2005, he was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President George W.

sports,Narine sinks Proteas in West Indies r,"strong>Providence, Guyana: Sunil Narine snared career-best figures of six for 27 on his return to West Indies colours as the hosts defeated South Africa by four wickets in the opening match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International series at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday.</strongForced to remodel his action after it was deemed illegal during the Caribbean side�s last ODI campaign in Sri Lanka last November, the 28-year-old mystery spinner was at his mesmerising best on a turgid surface where the South Africans were dismissed for 188 off 46.5 overs.They found it difficult to establish any sort of momentum despite two useful partnerships at the top of the order.Narine�s returns were not only a personal milestone but also the best-ever by any opponents in one-day cricket against South Africa.Kieron Pollard, back in the good graces of the West Indies selectors after 20 months in the ODI wilderness following the shock abandonment of the tour of India in October of 2014, then lifted his team to the target with 11 balls to spare with a robust unbeaten 67 that included six sixes.It was the first time in 15 years that the Caribbean side had defeated the South Africans in a one-dayer on home soil.Rilee Rossouw top scored with 61 and featured in a 78-run third-wicket partnership with skipper AB de Villiers.That effort followed an opening stand of 52 between Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla.However the Proteas collapsed from the comparative comfort of 160 for three, their last seven wickets falling for just 28 runs with Narine befuddling the South African middle and lower order.Rossouw was one of the spinner�s scalps, falling to a good low catch by Carlos Brathwaite at first slip.Brathwaite had earlier broken the opening stand of de Kock and Amla, de Kock attempting an injudicious heave to be comprehensively bowled.Narine then made his first strike by trapping Amla leg-before in the very next over.Yet it was the demise of de Villiers that proved to be the most crucial.Playing well within himself and being mindful of the challenging batting conditions, he compiled 31 off 49 deliveries without a single boundary but fell to a good catch off his own bowling by pacer Jerome Taylor at the start of the 31st over.South Africa had just ended a period of 23 overs without finding the boundary rope and it appeared de Villiers and Rossouw were on the cusp of acceleration before the captain�s departure.From then on it was the Narine show as he scythed through the rest of the visitors� batting.Set a relatively modest target, the West Indies opening pair of Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher rode their luck in a 37-run stand before the introduction of the spinners changed the complexion of the chase.Imran Tahir deceived and bowled both with googlies while Aaron Phangiso and part-timer J.P. Duminy removed Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin respectively to have the hosts wobbling at 76 for four.But Pollard, whose first three scoring shots were towering sixes, dominated a 74-run fourth-wicket stand with Darren Bravo to take the West Indies closer to the target.Bravo fell to Phangiso for 30 and Carlos Brathwaite, the final over hero of the World T20 triumph in India two months earlier, perished attempting a bit hit of Phangiso.But captain Jason Holder joined Pollard to ensure there were no more alarms on the way to a morale-boosting victory for a team classified as underdogs alongside the South Africans and ahead of Sunday�s meeting with World Cup holders Australia at the same venue.",6/4/2016,,

I feel young, fresh. I mean, the Alvarez fight, everything was going fine until I got caught with the big shot and that�s boxing for you sometimes. One punch can change the fight.

""But of course he wouldn�t listen.He did what he thought was right.And it turned out he was right, and I was wrong.

Federer missed this year's tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round.""Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me,"" he said.""But I guess I've got a few more years to try and (win more slams).

sports,Warner half century as Australia thrash Windi,"strong>Providence, Guyana: Australia wobbled near the finish yet still made an immediate statement in their opening match of the Tri-Nation Series at the Guyana National Stadium on Sunday, whipping the West Indies by six wickets in the second fixture of the tournament.</strongPut in to bat on a pitch that once again made strokeplay difficult, the West Indies collapsed from the relative comfort of 50 for one to be dismissed for 116 off just 32.3overs, losing the last nine wickets for only 66 runs on the way their lowest-ever total in a One-Day International against Australia in the Caribbean.Australia then wasted little time in getting to the modest target, David Warner stroking an unbeaten 55 to ensure that the scheduled day/night fixture was over with almost 25 overs to spare despite the loss of three wickets for seven runs with the end in sight.Spinners Sunil Narine, with two wickets in one over, and Sulieman Benn caused the discomfort but it was not enough to pull the hosts back from the abyss.The emphatic victory earned Australia a bonus point to move ahead of the West Indies in the three-team standings before Tuesday�s final game at Providence against South Africa.Boosted by a four-wicket win in the tournament-opener against the South Africans at the same venue two days earlier, the West Indies plummeted back down to earth at the feet of the World Cup-holders, whose frontline spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa did the bulk of the damage with three wickets apiece after the usual effective opening burst from Mitchell Starc.Playing his first international match for more than six months after being sidelined by injury, the left-arm fast bowler breached the defences of openers Andre Fletcher and Johnson Charles to finish with figures of two for 37 from nine overs.He showed signs of rustiness in delivering five wides and a no-ball, however his lethal pace proved more than a handful for the West Indies top order.Starc�s tally of ODI wickets is now at 92 in his 47th match and should he take eight more before the end of this competition he will eclipse Pakistan�s Saqlain Mustaq for the record as the fastest to 100 wickets in terms of matches played in this format of the international game.Charles topscored with a chancy 22 while all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite was last out for 21, Aaron Finch taking the catch at long-on to give Zampa his third wicket.Notwithstanding the turgid surface, the home batsmen contributed to their swift demise with a succession of poor shots, exemplified by Darren Bravo�s loose cover-drive at seamer Mitchell Marsh which offered a straightforward catch to Zampa at cover.Lyon, the experienced off-spinner, had an almost instant impact in disposing of Marlon Samuels and Kieron Pollard off successive deliveries. Pollard, whose unbeaten 67 guided the West Indies to victory over the Proteas two days earlier, attempted a heave over long-on to be taken by Warner on the boundary.Jason Holder gave mystery spinner Narine first use of the new ball from one end in hopes of an immediate breakthrough at the start of the Australian reply, but it was left to the captain to separate the opening pair as Warner and Finch got off to a flying start with a succession of boundaries on both sides of the wicket.They had put on 44 by the eighth over when Finch was leg-before for 19 in Holder�s first over, giving the gangling Barbadian his 50th wicket in One-Day International cricket.",6/6/2016,,
sports,American Muslims remember Ali as hero for their fai,"strong>NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES: The death of boxing great Muhammad Ali cost American Muslims perhaps their greatest hero, a goodwill ambassador for Islam in a country where their minority faith is widely misunderstand and mistrusted.</strong""We thank God for him,"" Talib Shareef, president and imam of the Masjid Muhammad mosque in Washington, told a gathering of Muslim leaders who honored Ali in Washington on Saturday, a day after he died in a Phoenix hospital at age 74. ""America should thank God for him. He was an American hero.""From the turmoil of civil rights and black Muslim movements of the 1960s to the darkest days after Sept. 11, 2001, Ali was a hero that U.S. Muslims could share with part of the American mainstream.Muslims remembered Ali for many familiar reasons, hailing him as a champion of social justice, a lifelong supporter of charitable works and an opponent of the U.S. war in Vietnam.Moreover, they said, he was a Muslim that a largely Christian country came to admire, even if Ali shocked and scared much of U.S. society after he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay in 1964.""When we look at the history of the African-American community, one important factor in popularizing Islam in America is Muhammad Ali,"" Warith Deen Mohammed II, son of the former Nation of Islam leader, said in a statement.With some 3.3 million adherents in the United States, Muslims make up about 1 percent of the population, largely immigrants and African-Americans who have embraced the religion.Although they have integrated into society better than some of their brethren in Europe, American Muslims face hardships even as the United State grows demographically less white and less Christian.Since 2001, they have suffered backlash from those Americans who equate all Muslims with those who have attacked civilians out of some jihadist cause.Decades before, black Muslim leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X rattled the white establishment as religious and ethnic minorities who demanded equality for their people. Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian.""The sanitizing of Ali's image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces,"" said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University.""He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America.""In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.""Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is,"" Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002.""Muhammad Ali was a gift from God,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, ""not only to Muslims but to the world.""",6/6/2016,,

He has progressed well to date and has the potential to become one of the best around,"" former Chelsea manager Mourinho, who replaced Dutchman Louis van Gaal last month, said.""We look forward to working with him to help nurture that raw talent.""Bailly has 15 caps for Ivory Coast and was part of their 2015 Africa Cup of Nations-winning squad.He played 47 times for Villarreal after joining in 2015 from Espanyol, impressing in a back four that conceded only 35 goals in 38 La Liga matches last season and reached the Europa League semi-finals, losing to Liverpool.""I want to progress to be the best that I can be and I believe working with Jose Mourinho will help me develop in the right way and at the right club,"" said Bailly, who will likely partner England's Chris Smalling in central defence next season.The capture of Bailly marks the first of an expected flurry of signings by Mourinho as he seeks to restore the fortunes of the 20-times English champions who won the FA Cup last season but finished fifth in the Premier League.United, who will play in the Europa league after missing out on Champions League place, are also favourites to sign Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic while Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has also been linked with a move to Old Trafford.",6/8/2016,,
sports,Sharapova banned for 2 years by ITF,"strong>Russian former world number one Maria Sharapova was handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation on Wednesday following her positive test for banned drug meldonium at this year's Australian Open.</strongIn a statement the ITF said the 29-year-old five-times grand slam champion's ban would be back-dated to Jan. 26 this year, meaning her results from the Australian Open where she reached the quarter-finals, would be disqualified.""An Independent Tribunal appointed under Article 8.1 of the 2016 Tennis Anti-Doping Programme has found that Maria Sharapova committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation under Article 2.1 of the Programme and as a consequence has disqualified the affected results and imposed a period of ineligibility of two years, commencing on 26 January 2016,"" the ITF said in a statement.Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, stunned the sporting world in March when she announced that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium.Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of banned substances at the start of the year after evidence that it boosted blood flow and enhanced athletic performance.After her admission, Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut its ties with Sharapova while other brands such as Nike and Porsche distanced themselves from her.The ban means she will miss this year's Wimbledon championships, the title she won as a teenager to launch her career into orbit in 2004, and the Rio Olympics.At the time Sharapova, the highest-profile tennis player to fail an anti-doping test, insisted she had made ""a huge mistake"" blaming her failure to read an email sent by the ITF that meldonium had been added to the WADA list.Sharapova has 35 WTA singles titles and has won all four of the sport's grand slam titles.Her career earnings amount to $36 million while her off-court earnings, according to Forbes, are around $200 million.",6/8/2016,,
sports,England reach for the whitewash against Sri L,"LONDON: England have knack of coming unstuck as they chase a Test series whitewash but they will hope to complete the job against Sri Lanka at Lord�s this week -- despite clear signs of improvement from the tourists.England are 2-0 up with one Test to play, but the match starting on Thursday has more riding on it than it might appear for the hosts after recent series victories ended on a low note.Last year, having won the Ashes, England suffered an innings and 46-run defeat by Australia in the fifth Test at The Oval.There was a similarly heavy reverse in South Africa in January when, 2-0 up with one to play, England lost the fourth Test at Centurion by 280 runs.Although they won the second Test against Sri Lanka in Chester-le-Street by nine wickets, there were warning signs for England during that success.Sri Lanka, having become the first team since New Zealand in 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, made 475 in the second knock in Durham -- including a fine hundred by Dinesh Chandimal.A typically good Lord�s pitch could make life harder still for fast bowlers in London, with the most even contest of the series so far in prospect.<br/> <br/> England�s two biggest doubts concern a pair of players who know Lord�s well as it is their Middlesex home ground.Top-order batsman Nick Compton has been struggling for runs, and fast bowler Steven Finn for wickets.With England having again selected a 12-man squad, it looks as if Compton will get another match at number three.Finn�s place is under threat from uncapped seamer Jake Ball, although England appear ready to retain the Middlesex quick.With England captain Alastair Cook now having completed the burdensome business of getting to 10,000 Test runs, the left-handed opener could be in the mood to make a major score at Lord�s.Meanwhile England new-ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad, first and third in the world Test bowler rankings respectively, will look to maintain their standing.Two years ago, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews scored a fine Test century in a thrilling draw at Lord�s where the match went down to the last ball.For this fixture, Sri Lanka may make changes to their side.Stylish wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera -- a late addition to the squad after his drugs ban was overturned by the International Cricket Council because of a faulty lab analysis in Doha -- could end more than six months out by replacing injured all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana (twisted ankle).Fast bowler Shaminda Eranga was reported for a suspect action during the second Test and is understood to have undergone tests at the England and Wales Cricket Board�s training centre at Loughborough University this week.Although Eranga is still available to play, Sri Lanka could give a debut to uncapped 29-year-old left-armer Chaminda Bandara in the absence of the injured Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera.�",6/8/2016,,
sports,Pakistans Diana hunts for glory in cricket and footb,"LAHORE: Diana Baig, the talented 20-year-old girl plays for Pakistan�s national team in both cricket and football. She represented the country as one of the ""Girls in Green"" at the recent World Twenty20 tournament in India, in between practicing her penalty shoot-out skills.She grew up playing street cricket and football with other children in the magnificent Hunza Valley, their makeshift arenas ringed by some of the world�s tallest mountains in northern Gilgit-Baltistan.Baig belongs to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, which largely freed her from the restrictions placed on other more conservative women in the Muslim country, where her gender is battling for greater freedom.From the streets, Baig began playing in community events and for local teams, and by 2010 she was leading the newly-formed Gilgit-Baltistan women�s team.Two years later, she was selected for Pakistan�s A side, and then as a reserve player for the 2013 World Cup. In 2015, she finally won her first international cap, playing for Pakistan against Bangladesh.Her journey to the forefront of Pakistani women�s football was even more dramatic.While playing cricket in Islamabad in 2010, Baig tried out for the Gilgit-Baltistan football team on a whim after friends told her they needed players.She made the team and, to her disbelief, in 2014 was selected to play for Pakistan at the SAFF Championships in Bahrain.She has been a member of the starting 11 as a defender ever since, she says, unable to hide her excitement.Baig has had to fight harder for her cricket career.Unlike in men�s cricket, Pakistan�s women�s players are not contracted and are selected on a match by match basis from lower-ranked teams, such as the several hundred playing at the provincial level.That means that there were times when Baig was in -- and times when she was out.Now Baig is fighting to maintain a crucial balance between her sporting dreams and education.""It becomes very hard,"" she says. ""I try to start from football... I play football in the morning, then our cricket training starts around 11 or 12 noon and continues until 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm.""After that, she says, she heads to her university hostel for food and drink. ""I start studying during the night, continuing until late.""With cricket taking up more and more time, her studies -- she is on a full scholarship at the university, where she is in her first semester of a health and physical education degree -- are suffering, Baig admits. ""But one has to manage it.""Though determined, she knows that one day she will have to choose. When asked which path she will take, she laughed.""You know, in Asia, there is more charm in cricket,"" she says, acknowledging her playing for the football team is the harder road.She adds: ""I see my future better in cricket.""",6/8/2016,,

sports,Colombia into last eight US bounce back at Copa Ameri,"PASADENA, United States: Colombia became the first side to reach the quarter-finals of the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday, while the United States thumped Costa Rica 4-0 to get their campaign back on track.Goals from AC Milan�s Carlos Bacca and Real Madrid star James Rodriguez secured a 2-1 win for Colombia over Paraguay in front of a vocal crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California.Victor Ayala gave Paraguay hope after pulling a goal back on 71 minutes but Colombia held on for three points which means they are assured of a top two finish in Group A and a place in the last eight.Colombia need only to draw against Costa Rica on Saturday to assure themselves of first place, leaving them a potentially easier quarter-final against the runner-up from Group B, which contains Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.In Tuesday�s other game, US striker Clint Dempsey scored his 50th international goal as the host nation bounced back from their 2-0 loss to Colombia on Friday with a convincing rout of Costa Rica.Dempsey opened the scoring from the penalty spot after nine minutes before Jermaine Jones and Bobby Wood struck just before half-time to effectively settle the contest.Substitute Graham Zusi added a fourth goal three minutes from time, which could prove crucial if goal difference comes into play.The win came as a welcome relief for US coach Jurgen Klinsmann, whose tenure has faced mounting criticism over the past 18 months after a series of disappointing performances in competitive matches.On Wednesday, Peru could join Colombia in the quarter-finals if they manage to defeat Ecuador in Glendale, Arizona in Group B.In Wednesday�s other game, five-time world champions Brazil face an intriguing matchup against Caribbean minnows Haiti in Orlando, Florida.�",6/8/2016,,
sports,S Africa back in business after ODI win over Australi,"strong>PROVIDENCE, GUYANA: South Africa roared back into contention in the Tri-Nation One-Day International series with a 47-run victory over Australia in the third match of the tournament at the Guyana National Stadium on Tuesday.</strongDefending a modest 189 for nine on another pitch that challenged the patience and technique of all batsmen, the Proteas bowlers were resisted only by opener Aaron Finch�s defiant 72 before he was ninth out as the World Cup-holders folded for 142 off 34.2 overs.By virtue of their margin of victory, South Africa also earned a bonus point and leapt from last to first on net run-rate over Australia, leaving hosts West Indies third.Competition resumes in St Kitts on Saturday with South Africa and Australia renewing their rivalry at Warner Park.Farhaan Behardien�s workmanlike innings of 62 held South Africa�s innings together and earned him the ""Man of the Match"" award. However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten 15 as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for 13 off seven probing overs.Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter-Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling. His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell, who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over.Playing his first ODI for almost 16 months, Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg-before.Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece, while Tabraiz Shamsi, the left-arm leggie, marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies.""We started well with the two seamers although this wasn�t the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives,"" captain A.B. de Villiers said. ""(Tabraiz) Shamsi was a handful for their batters. I didn�t see a lot of them picking him.""strong>- Tough games coming up -</strongEarlier, Australia�s fast bowling pair of Coulter-Nile and Josh Hazlewood proved most effective with two wickets each in restricting the Proteas after de Villiers surprisingly chose to bat first on winning the toss.""We didn�t adapt well enough with the bat today,"" was Smith�s assessment of his team�s reply. ""We�ve got a couple of tough games ahead of us now and we have to improve on this effort.""Coulter-Nile, who replaced Mitchell Starc from the opening victory over West Indies two days earlier, made the most of the opportunity with a spell of two for 38 off 10 overs.He claimed the vital wickets of de Villiers and J.P. Duminy in consecutive overs to reduce the South Africans to 104 for five midway through the innings, effectively killing off any realistic chance they had of posting a formidable total.Hazlewood was even more economical in conceding 20 runs off 10 metronomic overs. He earned an LBW verdict against Quinton de Kock to break the opening partnership with Hashim Amla and returned to get rid of Parnell.South Africa entertained hopes of a challenging total when de Villiers and Amla were at the crease. The two most experienced batsmen in the side put on 40 for the third wicket before Amla was run out for the third time in ODI�s against Australia.Wickets continued to fall regularly thereafter and it was left to the lower-order players Phangiso and Rabada to assist Behardien in lifting the South Africans closer to the 200-run mark.",6/8/2016,,

Actor Will Smith, who portrayed Ali in a 2001 movie, and former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis will be among the pallbearers.The festival, at the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts, was aimed at children, celebrating Ali's life with music, dance, and art and educational activities.Children had the chance to color butterfly and bee masks, an homage to Ali's famous quote about his boxing style, ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. The hands can't hit what the eyes can't see.""""Today is about making sure they've got that connection to Muhammad Ali,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in an interview on Wednesday. ""As they grow up they can reflect back on this, so his legacy can live for multiple, multiple generations.""The festival opened with the release of 30 Monarch butterflies into the air.Before Ali won the boxing heavyweight title or an Olympic gold medal, he was a young boy named Cassius Clay in Louisville who had his bicycle stolen, according to a story shared with festival attendees.

Suarez, nursing a hamstring injury when he joined up with the squad, has so far not played a single minute.Suarez appeared in the dugout and looked visibly frustrated at his failure to get on the pitch, at one point appearing to punch the dugout wall.Venezuela�s winner came on 36 minutes, when midfielder Alejandro Guerra cleverly spotted Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera off his line.Guerra unleashed a long-range effort from near the halfway line which the back-pedalling Muslera could only parry onto the bar before Salomon Rondon bundled in the rebound.Venezuela�s advance to the last eight is the biggest shock of the tournament so far.<br/> The Venezuelans are currently bottom of South America�s 10-team round robin qualifying competition for the 2018 World Cup; Uruguay are on top of the standings. <br/> <br/> Venezuela will now face Mexico in their final first round game to determine who finishes top of Group C.Mexico, who had beaten Uruguay 3-1 in their opening game, meanwhile proved too powerful for Caribbean minnows Jamaica in front of an 83,263 crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.With California�s large population of Mexican-Americans making it a virtual home game for �El Tri�, Mexico took the lead on 18 minutes when former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez nodded in his 45th international goal.Jamaica were denied what looked like a clear-cut penalty in the second half after striker Clayton Donaldson appeared to have been fouled in the area.The drama came in the 60th minute when Donaldson rounded his marker before being cut down by Yasser Corona. Replays showed the defender didn�t get a touch on the ball.Jamaica�s misery was sealed when Mexico�s Hirving Lozano picked out Hector Herrera in the area and the midfielder nudged the ball on for substitute Oribe Peralta to stroke the ball first time inside the right hand upright on the 81st minute./> ",6/10/2016,,

Perera, in his first match in more than six months after a drugs ban was rescinded because of a botched test, played some bold shots -- the best a straight drive off Finn for four.<br/>At lunch, Sri Lanka were 218 for six, having just avoided the follow-on.The second session saw England captain Alastair Cook off the field after being hit below his left knee while fielding close in shortly before lunch.<br/>Joe Root, England�s vice-captain, took the new ball as soon as possible.Herath chopped on off Broad and Perera, who clearly didn�t have much confidence in the tail, was caught behind after charging down the pitch and wildly slogging at Anderson.Perera�s exit was the start of a sequence that saw all of Sri Lanka�s last three wickets go down on 288.",6/11/2016,,

sports,Shearer and Cook head Queens sporting honour,"LONDON: England sporting captains past and present, Alan Shearer and Alastair Cook head the sports stars to receive honours in Queen Elizabeth II�s birthday honours list.Shearer, former skipper of the national football side, and present cricket captain Cook are both made Commanders of the British Empire (CBE).Several notable female sporting personalities also feature including Martine Wiltshire, the sitting volleyball player and Paralympian who lost her legs in the 7/7 London bombings, for her services to sport.Shearer, who is now a respected pundit with the BBC, gets his recognition for his charitable services to the community in North East England.Cook is made a CBE for his services to cricket. Last month he became, at 31 years and 157 days, the youngest player and first English batsman to reach the landmark of 10,000 Test runs.Both Shearer and Cook have already been honoured with the former receiving an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2001 and the latter a Member of the British Empire (MBE) following his sterling performances in the Ashes victory over Australia in 2010/11.Cook�s team-mate, former world number one ranked bowler Stuart Broad is also honoured with an MBE.The Queen made Saturday a double cause for celebration for Welsh rugby union refereeing great Nigel Owens as he receives an MBE.On Saturday he will become the record holder for refereeing Test matches as he takes charge of his 71st, the highly-charged Pacific Islands clash of Fiji v Tonga in the hot climes of Suva.Owens, 44, who refereed the Rugby World Cup final last year, paid tribute to the many people from the rugby world who had stood by him when he came out as a homosexual in 2007 -- a far cry from when as a younger man he contemplated suicide because he couldn�t bring himself to tell his parents.Britain�s success in the Davis Cup last year was recognised with Andy Murray�s older brother doubles specialist Jamie receiving an OBE as does the non-playing captain Leon Smith.Wiltshire, 42, lost 80% of her blood and was in a coma for 10 days after being caught up in the bomb at Aldgate tube station in 2005. Seven years later, she featured at the Paralympics in London.Other women to feature in the awards include Claire Williams, the deputy team principal of Formula 1 team Williams, who gets an OBE.Hayley Turner may have retired from the saddle but her feats as a female jockey have been noted by the Queen -- a noted enthusiast of the Turf -- as she gets a MBE.Turner more than mixed it with the likes of Frankie Dettori becoming the first woman to reach the landmark of 100 winners in a calendar year in 2008.",6/11/2016,,

sports,Chile scrape Copa win after penalty shocker,"FOXBOROUGH, United States: Arturo Vidal scored a controversial penalty deep into injury time as holders Chile snatched a dramatic 2-1 victory over Bolivia to keep their Copa America Centenario campaign alive here Friday.Bayern Munich star Vidal struck from the spot in the 10th minute of time added on after a hugely debatable penalty was awarded against Bolivian defender Luis Gutierrez for handball by US referee Jair Marrufo.Television replays showed Gutierrez had his right arm behind his back to avoid conceding a handball but Alexis Sanchez�s cross struck him on the shoulder and Marrufo pointed to the spot after the apparent intervention of the linesman.Bolivia�s players surrounded the referee for angry protests but Marrufo�s decision stood and it was left to Vidal to drive home the penalty.The result gives Chile hope of reaching the last eight following their opening defeat to Argentina in Group D.Earlier a stunning 61st minute free-kick from Kuwait-based playmaker Jhasmani Campos appeared to have grabbed a share of the points for Bolivia at Gillette Stadium after Vidal had given Chile the lead just after half-time.Bolivia, beaten by Panama in their first match, have zero points from two games.After a scrappy first half, Chile looked to have taken a decisive breakthrough immediately after the restart with Vidal�s goal.Arsenal star Sanchez dispossessed Juan Carols Arce just outside the Bolivia area and fed Mauricio Pinilla.Pinilla looked up and squared for Vidal who swept in an emphatic finish to make it 1-0 on 46 minutes.Yet Bolivia got back on level terms after Chile conceded a free-kick from around 25 meters, slightly out to the right.There appeared to be little danger but Campos stepped up and produced a spectacular long-range strike which curled late before dipping into the top corner beyond the fingertips of Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.",6/11/2016,,
sports,Sri Lanka hit back after Bairstow steers England to 416,"LONDON: Jonny Bairstow continued a brilliant year of run-scoring with a Test-best 167 not out against Sri Lanka at Lord�s on Friday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 162 for one in reply to England�s first innings 416, a deficit of 254 runs.Kaushal Silva was 79 not out and Kusal Mendis unbeaten on 25 after left-handed opener Karunaratne made exactly 50.Considering the start of this series saw Sri Lanka become the first side since 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, this was a fine effort.There had been signs of recovery in their last innings, where Sri Lanka made 475 in a nine-wicket defeat in the second Test, giving England an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match series.Karunaratne should have been out for 28 on Friday when he nicked all-rounder Chris Woakes, only for Bairstow to drop the two-handed waist-high chance.Karunaratne cashed in and after tea struck James Anderson, the world�s number one ranked Test bowler, for three fours in as many balls, including a well-hit drive.Yet having completed a 95-ball fifty, Karunaratne was dismissed when a leg glance was well caught by a diving Bairstow to give under-pressure fast bowler Steven Finn a wicket on his Middlesex home ground.Karunaratne�s exit ended an opening stand of 108 with Silva -- easily Sri Lanka�s best top-order partnership of the series.Silva took Sri Lanka to 150 with a sublime drive through extra-cover for four off Stuart Broad.It wasn�t until January that the 26-year-old Bairstow scored his first Test century.<br/> But since January 1 he has been in prolific batting form for both county champions Yorkshire and England, scoring 594 runs at an average of 118.8 in Tests and 1,127 runs in first-class cricket at 102.4.Friday saw Bairstow receive good support from Woakes (66) in a seventh-wicket partnership of 144.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka left-arm spinner Rangana Herath took an economical four for 81 in 36 overs.England resumed on 279 for six with Bairstow 107 not out and Woakes unbeaten on 23.Bairstow�s second century of the series, following his 140 on his Headingley home ground in the first Test, helped rescue England from the depths of 84 for four.Woakes was the initial aggressor on Friday and a boundary off Eranga saw him to a maiden Test fifty in 102 balls. But Woakes fell when caught and bowled by Herath off a chipped drive.Bairstow batted on and his leg-glanced four off Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews saw him surpass his previous Test-best 150 not out against South Africa at Cape Town in January.�",6/11/2016,,

I felt so terrified and nervous when I realised I was living with and amongst serial killers, rapists and drug dealers.""Rose said he has written to the International Cricket Council stating ""New Zealand is not a safe place for international cricketers, especially if they are black"".He said he would have left New Zealand earlier had he not ended up in hospital after being assaulted in November 2012.While in hospital recovering from his wounds, Rose developed a blood clot in his lungs which prevented him from flying, he said, saying this was the reason he remained in the country for as long as he did.Police superintendent Bill Searle said police ""strongly refute"" Rose�s claim that the assault was not investigated properly, and that the investigating officer ""racially stereotyped"" him.""A full and thorough investigation was carried out into Mr. Rose�s reported assault,"" Searle said.""Mr. Rose�s version of events was not able to be corroborated. Mr. Rose was advised of the outcome of his case and thanked the investigating officer.""Searle said Rose never complained to the police about his treatment and he later ""extended an invitation to the investigating officer to bring other members of police to attend a promotional event at a bar"".Searle said now Rose had made the sex assault complaint public, he could confirm the cricketer ""was the subject of a police investigation earlier this year, in relation to sexual assault"".""No charges were laid.

sports,Magical Messi grabs hat trick as Argentina romp into quarter,"CHICAGO: Lionel Messi scored a magical hat-trick in 19 minutes as Argentina cruised into the Copa America Centenario quarter-finals with a 5-0 rout of Panama on Friday.Messi had been forced to delay his debut in the tournament after a slow recovery from a lower back injury, with Argentina coach Gerardo Martino surprisingly naming him amongst the substitutes once more.But Messi wasted no time in stamping his genius on the tournament after coming on in the 61st minute to replace Augusto Fernandez with Argentina leading the Group D game 1-0.An electrifying cameo from the Barcelona superstar began with his first goal of the tournament on 68 minutes, finishing with aplomb after Gonzalo Higuain�s shot bounced off a Panamanian defender into his path.But there was no question of luck with his second, with Messi curling a wonderful free-kick into the top corner to bring the Soldier Field crowd to its feet in the 78th minute.With Panama�s heads down, Messi then duly completed his quick-fire hat-trick -- skipping clear of a marker inside the penalty area to finish emphatically for 4-0.There was still time for Messi to have a hand in Argentina�s fifth goal of the evening, providing a sublime pass in the build-up to Sergio Aguero�s close range headed effort in the 90th minute.Aguero�s Manchester City team-mate Nicolas Otamendi had opened the scoring for Argentina in the seventh minute, heading home an Angel Di Maria free-kick from close range.The victory sees Argentina, convincing 2-1 winners over Chile in their opening game, guaranteed a spot in the last eight with one group game remaining.The only blemish on the evening was an injury to Angel Di Maria, who limped off in the first half to extend his miserable record of injuries in major tournaments.Argentina are now firmly on course to top Group D, with only one game against pointless Bolivia to come.Friday�s win marked a dazzling return to the spotlight for Messi, who is determined to help lead Argentina to their first major international tournament victory for 23 years.Messi, a veteran of Argentina�s agonizing defeats in the 2014 World Cup final and 2015 Copa America final, had arrived in the United States nursing a back injury sustained during a friendly victory against Honduras last month.He was late joining up with the squad after returning to Spain to give evidence in his tax fraud trial.",6/11/2016,,

A fleet of limousines transporting Ali�s family and close friends followed in the cortege.Police officers jogged alongside the hearse as it passed Ali�s boyhood home, to keep the large crowd out of the street.""The kids love him, he�s always stood for hope in this neighborhood,"" Toya Johnson, who wore an Ali T-shirt, told AFP.""For the youth here, he is an example.""Born Cassius Clay in 1942, the boxer won Olympic gold and went on to a glorious professional career, with his epic fights -- like the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with George Foreman and the ""Thrilla in Manila"" with Joe Frazier -- now the stuff of sports legend.He shocked America by refusing to serve in Vietnam, a decision that cost him his title and his career for years.

A smoke bomb was later thrown in behind the Croatia goal.No other incidents were reported in a game under tight scrutiny after the ugly scenes that marred Saturday's match between England and Russia in Marseille.Technically the better side, the Croatians, who had one foot in the last four eight years ago until they fell to Turkey on penalties, kept alive their hopes of surviving a tough group also featuring holders Spain and the Czech Republic, who face each other in Toulouse on Monday.Turkey, who had failed to qualify for a major tournament since their impressive Euro 2008 campaign, now face a struggle to reach the knockout stages.Turkey looked nervous in the opening stages and Croatia dictated the pace, with Modric, named man of the match, and Ivan Rakitic pulling the strings in midfield.The game was lively but with no clear chance for either side until Croatia midfielder Milan Badelj offered the first shot on target with a volley from 20 metres that failed to surprise Babacan.Seconds later, Turkey threatened for the first time with a header by Ozan Tufan from a fine Gokhan Gonul cross.The game became scrappy with quite a few fouls, notably from Turkey, and Croatia defender Vedran Corluka had to play most of the match with a bandaged, bleeding head after being elbowed by striker Cenk Tosun while fighting for a high ball.Croatia looked in command after the break and created a few opportunities, notably when captain Darijo Srna rattled the crossbar from a free kick after Rakitic was brought down outside the box.Playing a major tournament in France brings back sweet memories for Croatia, who lost in the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup to host nation France before beating the Netherlands to finish third.",6/12/2016,,

sports,Pradeep treble rocks England in third T,"LONDON: Nuwan Pradeep took three wickets and did some serious damage to a couple of England careers as Sri Lanka fought to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test at Lord�s on Saturday.England in their second innings were 109 for four at the close of the third day, a lead of 237 runs. Alex Hales was 41 not out, having been dropped on 19 and 39, with nightwatchman Steven Finn, missed on one, unbeaten on six.England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, were rocking at 50 for three before first-innings century-maker Jonny Bairstow helped Hales add 52 for the fourth wicket.However Pradeep had Nick Compton out for 19, caught behind tamely pushing at Shaminda Eranga.Compton had been promoted to open in place of England captain Alastair Cook, after the left-hander suffered a knee injury fielding close in earlier on Saturday.England were now 45 for one and that quickly became 50 for three. Joe Root (four) was bowled by an absolute shooter from Pradeep. New batsman James Vince was out for a golden duck as he deliberately played no shot to a Pradeep delivery that nipped back down the Lord�s slope and knocked over his off stump.Bairstow, in at 84 for four in the first innings before making a Test-best 167 not out, survived the hat-trick. But on 32 he too was clean bowled by Pradeep.Pradeep ended the day with three for 25 in nine overs but his figures could easily have been better.Earlier, England all-rounder Chris Woakes started and finished a collapse that saw Sri Lanka, 162 for one overnight, dismissed for 288. That gave England, who made 416 in their first innings, a lead of 128.Woakes, who took a wicket with his first ball Saturday, ended the innings with the opening delivery of a new spell when Eranga was caught in the slips.<br/> Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes took three for 31 in 17.1 overs.Sri Lanka resumed Saturday with Kaushal Silva 79 not out and Kusal Mendis 25 not. But they both fell for their overnight scores as Sri Lanka subsided in the face of increasingly accurate fast bowling, with the overcast conditions making batting harder than had been the case on Friday.Woakes had Mendis lbw with his first ball Saturday before Silva was caught behind off Stuart Broad.Kusal Perera (42) and Rangana Herath (31) checked England�s progress with a seventh-wicket partnership of 71.Perera�s bold innings was particularly impressive as this was his first match in more than six months after a drugs ban was rescinded because of a botched analysis. He was eventually caught behind after wildly slogging at James Anderson to start a slump that saw Sri Lanka lose all their last three wickets on 288.",6/12/2016,,
sports,Warner ton helps Australia beat South Africa by 36 ru,"St. Kitts: Opening batsman David Warner made his first one-day international (ODI) century outside Australia to set his team on their way to a 36-run victory over South Africa in the fourth match of a triangular ODI series on Saturday.After Australia made a respectable 288 for six off their allotted 50 overs, South Africa looked to be cruising to victory for much of their innings at Warner Park in Basseterre, on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.However, a persistent Australian bowling attack finally took its toll and South Africa collapsed from 210/3 in the 38th over to lose their final seven wickets for only 42 runs and were all out for 252 off 47.4 overs.Warner made 109 from 157 balls on a pitch that, initially at least, was far more conducive to runs than the slow, low surface that hosted the first three games of the series in Guyana.It was his sixth ODI century, with his previous five coming on home soil.<br/> He later injured a finger diving for a catch and left the field for treatment.The result leaves Australia with two wins from three matches, while South Africa has one win from three.West Indies have one win from two matches, ahead of their game against Australia in St. Kitts on Monday.Fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and spinner Adam Zampa took three wickets each for Australia.Hazlewood picked up the prized wicket of South African captain AB de Villiers (39) with a superb delivery that swung late, beat the inside edge and collected middle stump.It proved to be the turning point of the match as de Villiers departed to leave South Africa 210/4, after which it all went awry for the Proteas.�",6/12/2016,,

""We lost a lot of possession in the first half.""In the second half we were better organised and had more control of the ball.""Mustafi's stoppage-time header back to keeper Manuel Neuer that almost gifted the Ukrainians a goal was indicative of the overall performance in defence.""It was an open game, a flowing game,"" said Mustafi. ""We had a situation where we were open -- it was a game we did not want.""Germany will draw confidence from Schweinsteiger's never-say-die attitude, with the holding midfielder's presence crucial to the team's overall spirit.Schweinsteiger has been injured for months, with his very participation in the Euros in doubt, and his goal could not have come at a better time to inspire the squad as they bid to win the competition for the fourth time.""We know now that we have to raise our level and hopefully we will do it for Poland,"" said Neuer.",6/13/2016,,

""It is a mark to say we are not happy with the decision. (It was unfurled) To show solidarity and fight back.""Ford said Tucker had apologised for the mistake and the coach was of the view that front-foot no-ball calls should be taken out of the on-field umpire's hand.""It just seems strange that with the technology that is available you can get a line call wrong,"" Ford said.""You'd think the best solution would be for the umpires to worry about what's going on down the other end and for technology to look after the line call.""Meanwhile, England paceman James Anderson was reprimanded for ""conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game"" during the match, the ICC said in a statement.Anderson was guilty of showing disrespect to umpire S Ravi, who had asked the paceman not to verbally engage with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath during the visitors' first innings.Sri Lanka resume Monday's final day on 32 for no loss, needing 330 more runs to salvage some pride in the series in which they have been thoroughly outplayed.",6/13/2016,,

Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime.Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half, relying on hopeful long balls forward, while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long-range effort from Khedira, a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil, when he was through on goal.Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer's head, leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net, while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process.Then, in the final seconds, with Ukraine pushing up, Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score.The result extended Germany's unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship.Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday, when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon.Several hours before the match, German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille, though police quickly brought the situation under control.",6/13/2016,,
sports,Flag protest fires up Sri Lanka in Lords no ball r,"LONDON: Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no-ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lord�s on Sunday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings, needing a further 330 runs on Monday�s fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362.More realistically, their goal was to prevent England, already 2-0 up in the three-match series, taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash.But England captain Alastair Cook, 49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding, may not have been able to declare his side�s second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lanka�s way instead.Significantly, Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales -- who went on to make 94 -- out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep. But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeep�s front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.In February, a similar incident saw Australia�s Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: ""The ICC have to look at it.""It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong,"" the South African added.""The best solution is for the umpires to worry about what�s happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call. ""The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down. That was a kick we didn�t need.""The Sri Lanka management reacted to Hales�s reprieve by draping the national over the tourists� dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes.Ford said this wasn�t so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle.""At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale --only for us to find out that�s not the done thing and we had to take it down,"" said Ford.He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake.""He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo. It was very good of him to have done that and we move on.""Hales, for all his good fortune Sunday, was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred.The Nottinghamshire opener, out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests, got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium-pacer Mathews.Somewhat ironically, in view of Sri Lanka�s earlier protest, Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists� favour on this occasion.""It�s disappointing again to come so close,"" said Hales, whose 126-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.""But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck -- bowled off a no-ball, umpires calls and edges -- I guess the luck ran out.""",6/13/2016,,

""(The referee) said he discussed it with four officials and that they didn't see the handball.""Brazil tried from the first minute to score but the ball didn't want to go in unfortunately, and that's football.

sports,Anil Kumble applies India coaching job repor,"strong>NEW DELHI: Spin bowling great Anil Kumble is among the biggest names to have applied for the high-profile job as India head coach, according to media reports.</strongThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said Sunday that it had received 57 applications for the post but did not reveal any names.Former team director Ravi Shastri, current chief selector Sandeep Patil and ex-pace bowler Venkatesh Prasad were among a few top former players who made their coaching intentions public.But on Monday Kumble, who has mentored Indian Premier League sides such as Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore, was reported to have also thrown his hat in the ring.""Yes, I have applied,"" the former India skipper was quoted as saying by The Indian Express newspaper.The 45-year-old bagged 619 Test wickets in 132 matches and is only the second bowler in cricket history after England�s Jim Laker to have taken all 10 in a Test innings.Kumble has previously served as the president of his state association in Karnataka and headed BCCI�s technical committee. He is currently the chairman of the ICC cricket committee.However Kumble does not fit the BCCI criteria of having ""coached a cricket team of any of the member countries of the ICC (International Cricket Council), at the first class or at the International level"".Overseas coaches such as Australia�s Stuart Law and Dav Whatmore, who was recently sacked by Zimbabwe, are also being floated by India�s media as possible applicants.The list will now be pruned by board secretary Ajay Shirke and the appointment of the new coach is expected to be made before India�s tour to the West Indies in July.",6/14/2016,,
sports,Cook ready for Pakistan after Sri Lanka su,"LONDON:c said he was looking forward to the challenge of facing Pakistan following his side�s commanding Test series win over Sri Lanka.Rain meant only 12.2 overs were possible at Lord�s on Monday as the third Test ended in a draw.But although denied a whitewash, England had already done enough to secure a 2-0 series win after dominant victories by an innings and 88 runs and nine wickets over the Lankans at Leeds and Chester-le-Street respectively.England now hold Test series trophies against every other major international side except Pakistan, who beat Cook�s men 2-1 in a three-match series in the United Arab Emirates in November last year.However, they will have a chance to put that right when they face Pakistan in a four-Test series starting at Lord�s on July 14.""They�ve got a very good (pace) attack, backed up with spinners,"" Cook said of Pakistan. ""We�re ready for them. We scored a lot of runs against Australia�s attack here last year -- I think it�s going to be a brilliant series.""While Test specialist Cook prepares for Pakistan, wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow will be looking to take his red-ball form into the intervening five one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.Bairstow�s recall into England�s one-day squad was announced just as he was being confirmed as both man-of-the-match at Lord�s and the hosts� overall man of the Test series too.His 167 not out in the first innings at Lord�s was his Test-best score and came amidst a series scoring-spree that saw Bairstow total 387 runs at an average of 129, with the Yorkshireman also holding 19 catches behind the stumps.Together with James Anderson, who took 21 wickets at a stunningly low average of 10.80, Bairstow was the central figure of the series.Bairstow repeatedly helped England recover from top-order collapses against Sri Lanka and Cook likened his contribution to that of retired former England wicket-keeper Matt Prior.Prior�s wicket-keeping came under intense scrutiny early in his career, especially as England -- be it Alan Knott, Bob Taylor or Jack Russell -- have long prided themselves on their glovemen.Bairstow, himself the son of the late former Yorkshire and England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, also found his work in the field being called into question after he floored a couple of seemingly straightforward chances against Sri Lanka.Bairstow, meanwhile, was pleased at maintaining the form he showed in South Africa, where his 150 not out in Cape Town in January gave him a maiden Test century.For Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, the hope is his side, having had time to adjust to English conditions, will raise their game in the white-ball formats.<br/> However, the all-rounder accepted England were a much improved one-day team from the side that Sri Lanka thrashed by nine wickets at last year�s World Cup in Wellington.�",6/14/2016,,

sports,Ireland can build on draw after Sweden disappoi,"strong>Ireland can take encouragement from a 1-1 draw in their Euro 2016 Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents' desire.</strongIreland were the better team and Sweden were fortunate to grab an equaliser when Irish defender Ciaran Clark headed a cross into his own goal after Wes Hoolahan had opened the scoring with a splendid strike early in the second half.It was another misfortune for Ireland at the Stade de France, where they were playing for the first time since Thierry Henry's infamous handball for France led to a goal that crushed the 2010 World Cup qualifying dreams of the Irish in a playoff.Monday's match was probably the one the Irish and Swedes had targeted for a win in a section that also features traditional European force Italy and a talented Belgium side.Martin O'Neill's Boys in Green, however, can be more optimistic than Erik Hamren's Blue-Yellows, who did not manage a single shot on target despite the efforts of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was kept fairly quiet by Ireland's defence.""We have two very, very tough matches coming against two sides that are very classy,"" said O'Neill.""But if I can take anything from the performance today, it was that the players looked accomplished. We have the desire but the players are growing into international football.""Both teams were backed by hordes of fans and the yellow and green armies brought a festive touch to the Stade de France, in sharp contrast with the violence that has marred the tournament.O'Neill's side showed a real desire to win, making two attacking substitutions after Sweden's equaliser, while the Scandinavians looked slow and toothless until Ireland took a deserved lead three minutes after the break.Hoolahan struck a superb half-volley into the net from Seamus Coleman's perfect cross into the area triggering a roar rarely heard in the usually subdued Stade de France.strong>MATCH-WINNING CHANCE</strongThat acted as a wake-up call for Sweden, who were relying on their enigmatic 34-year-old captain Ibrahimovic.""I came like a king, left like a legend,"" Ibrahimovic quipped as he left Paris St Germain at the end of last season after helping them win a second straight domestic treble.He was certainly neither when he returned to Paris on Monday.In the first half, Ibrahimovic looked lost on a pitch where which he won two French Cup and two League Cup trophies and, while he produced the cross that led to Ireland's own goal, the striker failed to convert a chance in the closing stages.In the 71st minute, Ibrahimovic made a rare break down the left flank into the area and his cross was headed into his own goal by the unfortunate Clark.Twelve minutes later, however, Ibrahimovic just failed to connect as Martin Olsson's cross whizzed in front of him, missing the chance to score an almost certain winner albeit undeserved.""The feeling right now is disappointment rather than coming back for a draw,"" said Hamren.""For the first 50 minutes Ireland were better. Credit to Ireland. Our attack was really bad in the first half. They were able to close us down.�We didn�t lose but I�m disappointed because we didn�t play the way we should have done.""Ibrahimovic added: ""I tried but I can do much better,""",6/14/2016,,
sports,Samuels sparks West Indies over Australi,"Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis: Marlon Samuels produced his best batting effort in One-Day International cricket against Australia to lead the West Indies to a six-wicket victory in the fifth match of the Tri-Nation series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.Set a challenging target after Usman Khawaja�s 98 and supporting half-centuries from skipper Steve Smith (74) and George Bailey (55) lifted the visitors to 265 for seven batting first, the enigmatic Samuels stroked 92 to ensure that the target was reached with 20 deliveries to spare.The Jamaican right-hander made an important deposit on a significant overdraft against the World Cup-holders, his innings spanning 87 deliveries and decorated with eight fours and four sixes -- the last three of which came off consecutive balls from leg-spinner Adam Zampa over long-off.In keeping with his mercurial nature, he was run out off the very next delivery to have the West Indies at 240 for four in the 41st over. Two more wickets fell to Nathan Coulter-Nile with the score at 254 before Kieron Pollard and Carlos Brathwaite formalised victory in the 46th over.Denesh Ramdin also played a key role in the run-chase. He supported Samuels in a 73-run fourth-wicket stand and continued to play sensibly following the demise of his senior partner before being bowled by Coulter-Nile for 29.Victory pulled the West Indies within a point of leaders Australia in the three-team standings. West Indies next play South Africa on Wednesday at the same venue.Samuels had joined Darren Bravo at the crease following a rollicking opening stand of 74 in ten overs before all-rounder James Faulker removed Fletcher for 27 while Zampa trapped Charles in front for 48.Bravo and Samuels then steadied the West Indies chase, keeping them well on course in an 82-run third-wicket partnership that was broken when Zampa removed Bravo for 39 via at bat-pad catch that lobbed comfortably to wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Earlier, Khawaja�s promotion to open the batting in the absence of the injured David Warner paid immediate dividends.He lost Aaron Finch in the very first over to West Indies captain Jason Holder but then featured in a 170-run second-wicket partnership with Smith, who overcame the nagging discomfort of a right leg injury to help put his team in a commanding position by the time he departed in the 35th over, the victim of a clever change of pace from all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.Khawaja was on the verge of a maiden ODI hundred but, becalmed in the nineties, he took on the challenge of a third run for his third-wicket partner, Bailey, and was found short of his ground by Jerome Taylor�s return from the boundary to stand-in wicketkeeper Fletcher. His innings occupied 123 deliveries and was embellished by three sixes and four fours.Fletcher�s position behind the stumps was the result of an injury to Ramdin who fell heavily on his right shoulder when attempting to effect a run out a few overs earlier. He returned for the final overs, taking two catches to dismiss Travis Head and Bailey off Pollard.Head earned his selection after Warner was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a broken finger sustained against South Africa on Saturday.

sports,Rain has final say as England and Sri Lanka draw third T,"LONDON: Rain ensured England and Sri Lanka drew the third Test at Lord�s on Monday, a result that saw England win the three-match series 2-0.Sri Lanka set 362 to win, finished on 78 for one after rain, which had prevented any play before lunch on the final day, finally saw the umpires abandon the match as a draw at 5:12 pm local time (1612 GMT).Dimuth Karunaratne was 37 not out and Kusal Mendis 17 not out.Monday�s result left Sri Lanka still searching for their first Test win at Lord�s, having now drawn six and lost two of their longest-format clashes at the �home of cricket�.Only 22 balls were possible between lunch and tea after rain washed out Monday�s first session, but that was long enough for Sri Lanka to lose opener Kaushal Silva.Sri Lanka resumed Monday on 32 without loss. Karunaratne was 19 not out and Silva unbeaten on 12.Monday�s first over saw Silva edge Broad just short of England captain Alastair Cook at first slip. But Anderson, England�s all-time leading Test-wicket taker, struck when Silva, padding up after failing to pick an inswinger going against the Lord�s slipe, was lbw for 16.Silva reviewed but to no avail, with Sri Lanka 45 for one. No sooner had Silva been dismissed than the umpires took the players off the field after just 18 minutes� play. But the weather relented for play to resume after tea. Even though the floodlights were on, there was now a risk the match might be halted for bad light.Bairstow�s Test-best 167 not out and 85 from Cook were the major contributions to England�s first innings 416. Sri Lanka could only manage 288 in reply, despite fifties from Karunaratne and Silva.England�s second innings 233 for seven declared saw Alex Hales again fall short of a maiden Test century with 94 -- his third fifty of a series where the opener had twice been dismissed in the 80s.Sri Lanka continue their tour with two one-day internationals against Ireland in Dublin on Thursday and Saturday. They then face England in the first at Nottingham�s Trent Bridge in the first of five one-dayers on June 21.Monday�s draw meant England lead the inaugural Super Series against Sri Lanka by 10 points to two.

sports,Hungary earn shock 2 0 win over 10 man Austri,"BORDEAUX: Adam Szalai and Zoltan Stieber scored second-half goals as Hungary stunned highly-fancied Austria 2-0 in their Group F opener in Bordeaux on Tuesday (Jun 14).Austria, tipped as tournament dark horses, dominated the opening period but Szalai fired Hungary ahead on 62 minutes with Stieber wrapping up a shock victory over their old rivals late on in the 138th meeting between the sides.Aleksandar Dragovic was sent off for Austria shortly after Szalai ended an 18-month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup.Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40-year-old to feature at the European Championship, surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history.Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line-up.However, they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left-footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post.The versatile Alaba, operating in his customary central midfield with Austria, soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first-time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic.Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free-kick in a rare opening for Hungary, while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten, but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post.Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes, though, as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right-hand side of the penalty area.Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period, his stinging 30-yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner.And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai, who was played onside by Fuchs, with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014.Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area, but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking.And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as Hungary completed a stunning upset for their first European Championship win since 1964.��",6/15/2016,,

But this trip also provides an opportunity to pause to reflect on, and celebrate, the wider historical, cultural and community links that exist between our two great cricketing nations,� Cameron said in the message.�As you break your fast together on the eve of your departure to the UK, please accept my very best wishes for the Holy month of Ramadan.

It is also because of the power of sport to achieve all the things that I, as a diplomat, try to do to bring our two countries together. Our respective cricket teams � Men and Women�s � have ambassadorial powers that I can only dream of.�Sport is particularly powerful in reaching out to the young, who represent the future of our two countries � and are the focus of so much of the UK�s work here. Indeed, alongside our education work, this magnificent British Council library, which I opened only two weeks ago is another important example of that.��I haven�t forgotten who pays my salary, fond though I am of Pakistan, so I won�t pretend that I will be supporting anyone other than the home team. But my biggest hope is for a great summer of sport, where the cricket does the talking. And I wish Pakistan�s teams a fabulous stay in Britain.�",6/16/2016,,

But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to people�s homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screen�s high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasn�t stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.",6/17/2016,,

He has had 20 shots so far at the tournament, more than nine entire teams have managed, but has still to score.Hailed as potentially tough opponents after an impressive qualifying campaign, Austria, ranked 10th in the world, again failed to live up to expectations after a 2-0 defeat by Hungary in their opener.Hungary top the group with four points after earlier snatching a 1-1 draw against Iceland, who are level with Portugal on two points and ahead of Austria on one.Portugal, who were knocked out in the first round at the 2014 World Cup, face a tense final match against Hungary while Austria will play Iceland on Wednesday.Asked about Ronaldo, Portugal coach Fernando Santos snapped.""I understand you and don't talk to you about Cristiano,"" he told a news conference.""Of course we're going through a tough time but we need to switch back immediately and can't wallow in our own misery. The next match is a final for us.""We faced a very strong Portuguese team but we ran a lot and we fought hard,"" said Asutria coach Marcel Koller.strong>THREE CHANCES</strongPortugal, held 1-1 by Iceland in their opener, had three opportunities in the space of three minutes early on but Nani, Vieirinha and William Carvalho were denied by alert keeper Robert Almer.""Messi, Messi,"" sang the Austria fans gleefully after Ronaldo missed the target as he latched on to Nani's cross into the area in the 22nd minute.Portugal came closer seven minutes later when Nani's header hit the woodwork.Stefan Ilsanker bossed the Austria midfield, breaking up several Portugal attacks and orchestrating play for his team mates as David Alaba appeared to be having an off night.Ilsanker provided Austria with their first shot on target early in the second half with a powerful low drive that was tipped away by Rui Patricio.Ronaldo was then denied twice in quick succession, Almer parrying away a shot from 20 metres and a header to keep his team afloat as Portugal stepped up the pressure.Alaba and Ricardo Quaresma, both supposed to provide a creative spark for their respective teams, were substituted midway through the second half after disappointing displays.Ronaldo had the perfect chance to snatch the points for Portugal after being fouled by Martin Hinteregger but his penalty struck Almer's right-hand post and six minutes later he was given offside after planting a precise header into the net.After his wretched night, Ronaldo, much criticised already at the tournament for a lack of humility after his dismissive comments about Iceland's tactics in their previous match, demonstrated a dignified side.When a fan stepped onto the pitch at the final whistle, Ronaldo asked a couple of stewards to let the intruder take a selfie with him. For one moment, he got something right.",6/19/2016,,
sports,Hend secures victory in Queens Cu,"BANGKOK: Australian big hitter Scott Hend overcame a two-shot deficit to snatch victory in the Queen�s Cup on Thailand�s Koh Samui island on Sunday as overnight leader Prom Meesawat stumbled.The 42-year-old finished the day with a four-under-par 67, one shot ahead of runner-up and local talent Gunn Charoenkul in the $300,000 competition at the Santiburi Samui Country Club.It was Hend�s second title of the season and his ninth career victory on the Asian Tour.Hend, the most successful international player on the tour, said he was pleased to make up for some recent near-wins in Mauritius and China.""Whether this was my golf course or not, I�ve been playing very good golf and trying to not get down on myself. It�s nice to win again,"" he said, according to a report by tour organisers.Two late bogeys saw Thailand�s Prom go from starting the day out in front to ending with a disappointing 72.He finished in joint third alongside American Paul Peterson, Korea�s Wang Jeung-hun and Thailand�s Pavit Tangkamolprasert.",6/19/2016,,
sports,Mathews tells Sri Lanka to up their game against England,"Malahide, Ireland: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said his side will have to be at their best to beat England in the five-match one-day international series which starts on Tuesday.Mathews was speaking after overseeing a 2-0 ODI series victory over Ireland in Malahide after the second match was won by an emphatic 136-run margin on Saturday.Opening batsman Kusal Perera, who would have missed the tour had a drugs ban not been rescinded following a faulty doping analysis, made a century to build the platform for his side�s huge total of 377 for 8.""We still can improve a lot in all departments. It was a pretty convincing victory today, but we need to be at our best to beat England,"" said Mathews.Eoin Morgan�s England have improved dramatically in 50-over cricket since the Sri Lankans thrashed them by nine wickets in Wellington during last year�s World Cup.Seekkugge Prasanna came in a three to pinch-hit in explosive style, bludgeoning nine sixes and five fours to leave his previous best ODI score of 42 far behind with 95 from just 46 balls.The fifth and sixth overs of the Ireland reply were maidens and when captain William Porterfield was out to the first ball of the seventh over, Ireland, who have never beaten Sri Lanka in five attempts, could not cope. It needed a last wicket stand of 54 between Andrew McBrine and former England international Boyd Rankin to get the Ireland total over 200.The man of the series was Sri Lanka�s Dasun Shanaka, who scored 42 off 19 balls and took five wickets on his debut in the tourists� 76-run win in the first match on Thursday and Mathews has high hopes for the 24-year-old.Perera took advantage of the very good pitch to score 135, his second ODI century, before he was the second of three dismissals in the space of five balls. <br/> He faced 128 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes, and was happy to play second fiddle to Prasanna, who dominated an electrifying second-wicket stand of 161 in 89 balls.The late flurry of wickets allowed Ireland to restrict Sri Lanka to 67 from the last eight overs, when a total of 400 had looked likely.Suranga Lakmal was Sri Lanka�s most successful bowler. Sharing the new ball with Mathews, he dismissed both Ireland openers in the space of 10 balls, broke the stubborn seventh wicket stand between Stuart Poynter (36) and McBrine (79 off 64 balls) and added a fourth wicket at a personal cost of just 38 runs.Prasanna completed a fine all-round game with two for 32 from eight overs, and although Shanaka took only one wicket in his second game, it was the big one of the dangerous Kevin O�Brien.",6/19/2016,,
sports,Vargas scores four as Chile thrash Mexico 7 0,"Santa Clara, United States: Eduardo Vargas scored four goals as holders Chile sent Mexico spinning to a historic 7-0 defeat to reach the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.Hoffenheim forward Vargas completed a hat-trick in 13 devastating minutes either side of half-time to send Chile into a semi-final against Colombia in Chicago on Wednesday.The drubbing was Mexico�s worst ever defeat in the finals of a major tournament. Their previous biggest loss was a 6-0 rout by West Germany at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina.The rout was also only one goal away from equalling Mexico�s heaviest ever defeat in any international, an 8-0 thrashing by England in London in 1961.Vargas grabbed his fourth goal in the 74th minute to give Chile a 6-0 lead.<br/> But the punishment did not finish there with Edson Puch adding a seventh in the 88th minute for his second of the match.Chile, winners of last year�s Copa America on home soil, had faced an intimidating atmosphere in front of a crowd of 70,547 people at the Levi�s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.But despite the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd, Chile were quicker to settle, with Puch opening the scoring on 16 minutes when he steered in a rebound from Marcelo Diaz�s shot after Guillermo Ochoa could only parry away.Vargas grabbed a second a minute before half-time to stun the crowd into silence as the teams headed in for the break.Chile then cut loose early in the second half with slick inter-play ripping apart a feeble Mexican defense at will.Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez made it 3-0 in the 49th minute before two more goals from Vargas in the 52nd and 57th minutes piled on the agony for Mexico.Several Mexican players visibly wilted in the face of the onslaught, and for periods the game resembled a training exercise for Chile as they swept forward relentlessly.<br/> Vargas�s fourth made it 6-0 on the night before Puch then toe-poked home to complete the scoring.Brazilian referee Heber Lopes spared Mexico the possibility of greater humiliation, whistling for full-time almost on the stroke of 90 minutes, with no time added on.",6/19/2016,,
sports,Messi record as Argentina thrash Venezu,"Foxborough, United States: Lionel Messi scored a record-equalling 54th international goal as Argentina outclassed Venezuela 4-1 to book their place in the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.The Barcelona superstar scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the 60th minute at the Gillette Stadium to equal Gabriel Batistuta�s long-time Argentina international goalscoring record.Messi also created a goal for Gonzalo Higuain, who scored twice, and second half substitute Erik Lamela as Argentina set up a semi-final against the United States in Houston on Tuesday.Messi is determined to lead Argentina to their first trophy in 23 years after a series of agonizing near-misses which include defeats in the finals of last year�s Copa America and the 2014 World Cup final.Messi�s genius created the opening goal after eight minutes, with the playmaker lofting a sublime curling pass to pick out Higuain�s run into the area.Napoli forward Higuain still had plenty to do but skillfully directed a first time strike past Venezuela goalkeeper Dani Hernandez for a wonderful goal.Argentina remained firmly in control but were jolted in the 27th minute when Nicolas Gaitan picked up a needless yellow card for a kick on Alexander Gonzalez that will see him suspended for the semi-final.Argentina�s dominance clearly had Venezuela rattled, and the Vinotinto�s defensive unease led to the next goal.A slack backpass from Arquimedes Figuera went straight to Higuain in space, and the striker coolly rounded Hernandez to stroke home his second of the night to make it 2-0 after 29 minutes.But just when it looked as if the floodgates would open, Venezuela rallied impressively and had Argentina rocking with a series of chances.<br/> <br/> West Bromwich Albion striker Salomon Rondon forced a save from Sergio Romero and hit the woodwork in quick succession.Romero was left scrambling to save once again just before half-time, when fullback Rolf Feltscher�s long-range shot deflected off Gabriel Mercado and looped up and over the Argentina keeper.Venezuela looked to have a justifiable claim for a penalty when Higuain brought down Josef Martinez in the box but Mexican referee Roberto Garcia was unmoved. <br/> Seconds later though Garcia was pointing to the spot after Romero clumsily bundled over Martinez for a clear penalty.But Venezuela�s pressure went unrewarded when Luis Manuel Seijas tried a risky ""Panenka"" down the middle which Romero read and gathered with ease.Venezuela were unable to renew their period of pressure in the second half, and Messi effectively put the contest to bed with his record-equalling goal in the 60th minute, which came after Argentina pressed high to force a turnover.Gaitan won the tackle and passed to Messi, who quickly played a one-two with the Benfica winger before poking his finish between Hernandez�s legs.Rondon pulled a goal back with a header in the 70th minute, but Messi�s response was instant, threading a pass to Lamela whose shot crept in at Hernandez�s near post.",6/19/2016,,

""I�m here now.

So there�s no reason I can�t go out and do it again tomorrow,"" he said.No player from the Republic of Ireland has ever won the US Open, although Northern Irishmen Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy have both won the tournament in recent years.To join them, he will need to hold off a talented chasing pack that includes major winners Jason Day and Zach Johnson as well as three players desperate to finally bag a major title in Lee Westwood, Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson.",6/19/2016,,
sports,Perera ton sets up SLanka series win over Ireland,"strong>Malahide, Ireland: Kusal Perera and Seekkuge Prasanna both made career-best scores as Sri Lanka beat Ireland by 136 runs in the second one-day international at Malahide on Saturday.</strongVictory saw Sri Lanka enjoy their second heartening win in a matter of days as they took the two-match series 2-0 and gave them a confidence boost ahead of their upcoming five-game ODI campaign in England.Put into bat, they amassed 377 for eight. Perera top-scored with an ODI best 135 and Prasanna made 95 -- his highest score at this level.Ireland, in reply, were bowled out for 241.Sri Lanka, again sent into bat as they had been in their 76-run win in the first ODI at Malahide on Thursday, were well-placed at the half-way stage.And when Suranga Lakmal and the recalled Farveez Maharoof removed Ireland�s top three with just 41 on the board, the rest of the match proved a formality.John Anderson, an accountant and the only amateur in the Ireland side, showed promise for the future with 34 and Andy McBrine, batting at No 8, finished the innings in some style with 79 from 64 balls, including seven fours and two sixes.McBrine and Boyd Rankin (18 not out) delayed the inevitable with a last wicket stand of 54 -- both making their highest scores for Ireland and Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews had to bring himself back to break the partnership and win the match with five overs to spare.Sri Lanka, put in on another excellent batting pitch, made the perfect start with Kusal Perera and Danuska Gunathilaka sharing an opening stand of 147.Gunathilaka was the first to go, in the 27th over, for 63, just two short of his ODI best, but both Perera and Prasanna easily passed their previous highest scores at this level.Prasanna, promoted to a pinch-hitting role at number three, played his role to perfection to more than double his career best in a superb display of hitting.He was dismissed five runs short of a deserved century having faced just 46 balls with nine sixes and five fours and he dominated the second wicket stand of 161 with Perera which took just 93 balls.Perera reached his second ODI hundred from 105 balls with 10 fours and two sixes and added another 35 before he was caught at mid-wicket off Middlesex�s Tim Murtagh.In all he faced 128 balls and finished with 16 fours and two sixes.Sri Lanka were on course for a total in excess of 400 but Ireland pulled them back by taking four wickets for 13 runs in the last three overs, although by then the damage had been done.Barry McCarthy, a 23-year-old seamer in only his second international, was Ireland�s most impressive bowler, finishing with two for 52.By contrast Boyd Rankin, in his first home series for five years after appearing for England, finished with one for 86 from his 10 overs.Ireland will now look for an improved showing when they face Pakistan in a two-match home ODI series in August.",6/19/2016,,

Peter Moor (31 from 32 balls) was the only one to muster any sort of resistance.Debutant seamer Barinder Sran took for wickets to lead the Indian charge, while fellow paceman Jasprit Bumrah picked up three wickets in his four overs.India also handed a debut to seamer Dhawal Kulkarni, though he was by far the most expensive of the bowlers as his one wicket cost 32 runs.",6/20/2016,,

sports,Dustin Johnson wins first major golf title amid rules controversy,"strong>Long-hitting American Dustin Johnson, seeking major redemption after several near-misses in recent years, won the 116th U.S. Open on Sunday amid high drama and initial uncertainty over his victory margin.</strongIn pursuit of his first grand slam crown, the world number six played clutch golf under intense pressure at brutally difficult Oakmont Country Club, finishing in style as he sank a short birdie putt at the last.Having negotiated the final seven holes under notice that he might be penalised for a rules infraction on the fifth green, despite being cleared by another official at the time, he was docked a shot after the round's completion, with his score amended to a closing 69 for a four-under winning total of 276.After sinking the final putt to clinch his 10th PGA Tour victory, Johnson pumped his right fist in delight, and then lifted his putter to acknowledge the loud roars from the crowd before being embraced by his caddie.""Feels good, feels really good, feels well deserved,"" an emotional Johnson said after finishing three shots in front of fellow Americans Jim Furyk (66) and Scott Piercy (69), and Ireland's Shane Lowry (76).Lowry had been four ahead after the weather-delayed third round was completed earlier on Sunday but he struggled in the conditions while piling up seven bogeys.""I've had a lot of opportunities that I didn't quite get done, so this one's definitely really sweet,"" said Johnson. ""I knew I was swinging well, and I just kept thinking, it's just me and the course.""I'm playing against the course. I can't control what anyone else does. So I just tried to hit golf shots, tried to hit it on the correct side of the hole, and two-putt.""The rules controversy was sparked when Johnson's ball moved slightly as the American was preparing to attempt his par putt at the fifth hole, shortly after his birdie attempt there from five feet broke left and slid past the cup.He denied having caused the movement and the official accompanying the pairing decided not to levy a penalty.After being informed on the 12th tee by a U.S. Golf Association official that he might be penalised after the round, Johnson ran up a three-putt bogey at the 14th but otherwise displayed nerves of steel as he negotiated the closing stretch.He rolled in a 10-footer to save par at the 16th and thunderous roars of ""DJ, DJ, DJ"" rang out as the crowd gave vocal support to the tournament leader in his bid for a first major victory after a series of heartbreaks in the past.Johnson had previously recorded 11 top-10s in the majors without winning, including two-runner-up spots, and he missed a three-foot putt at the final hole to hand last year's U.S. Open at Chambers Bay to Jordan Spieth.On Sunday, however, Johnson was remarkably composed in the circumstances and made several clutch putts on a day when the entire field struggled on greens running lightning-fast.""After last year, to come back and perform like this, I think it shows what kind of golfer I am,"" said the 31-year-old. ""I've knocked on the door a bunch of times.

It's something we'll have to continue to work on, but I believe it will come because I think we have players in the team who can score goals and who will score goals.""England have five points, behind Wales, who beat Russia 3-0, on six, and will play their last 16 tie in Nice on June 27.Slovakia, on four points, must wait to see if they go through as one of the four best third-placed teams.""England have very good attacking quality,"" said goalkeeper Matus Kozacik, who was man of the match.""We needed at least one point and managed to get it, and I hope with the four points we'll manage to get through.""England made six changes and their new-look lineup created several chances, with Jamie Vardy, Adam Lallana, Nathaniel Clyne and substitute Deli Alli all coming close.But despite the roar of their fans, who vastly outnumbered Slovakia's in the St Etienne stadium known locally as the cauldron, they could not find a way through the Slovak defence.strong>SELECTION GAMBLE</strongHodgson took a major gamble by revamping the side that beat Wales 2-1 last Thursday, including resting captain Wayne Rooney, and saw his team make a bright start.Vardy posed a constant threat in the first half and full back Clyne, replacing Kyle Walker, regularly troubled the Slovak defence with probing runs down the right wing.Vardy fired just over the bar in the opening minutes, and then flicked on a header that set up a chance for strike partner Daniel Sturridge.Soon after, Vardy outsprinted fullback Martin Skrtel, running onto a long ball inside the penalty area but firing his shot straight at keeper Kozacik.In one of England's best moves, a pass from Clyne set up Lallana for a stinging shot that forced a diving two-handed save from Kozacik.For Slovakia, Viktor Pecovsky shot harmlessly over the bar, and Marek Hamsik wriggled clear of centre-half Gary Cahill and fired across the face of goal.With Wales leading Russia at halftime, England came out for the second half knowing they needed to score in their quest to finish top.They had one anxious moment in particular when a mix-up between goalkeeper Joe Hart and defender Chris Smalling nearly let in Robert Mak, but otherwise they continued to put Slovakia under pressure.Clyne's shot from a narrow angle bounced off the keeper's shoulder and Alli, with his first touch after coming off the bench, forced a goal line clearance from Skrtel.With Prince William, among the crowd, grimacing and holding his head at a series of near-misses, England kept pushing for a goal but to no avail.Hodgson now faces a potentially tougher route in the competition with France, Germany and Italy all in the same half of the draw.He also has a selection dilemma, especially after Clyne had an outstanding match in place of Walker, who excelled against Russia and Wales. Three games into the tournament, the England boss may still be searching for his best team.",6/21/2016,,

To finish top is a fantastic feeling.""""It's probably the best performance I've been involved in with Wales,"" Bale added.",6/21/2016,,

Argentina reached the finals of their last two tournaments, the Copa America in 2015, and the World Cup in 2014, but were narrowly beaten in both. ""When you concede a goal after three minutes against such a team... that's when you've already lost your mental battle,"" Klinsmann lamented.

sports,Pak women give up first ODI after Knight shines on debut as captai,"LONDON: Heather Knight had a dream first match as England women�s captain starring with both bat and ball in a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in Leicester on Tuesday.Knight, who replaced Charlotte Edwards after the long-serving batsman was effectively forced into retirement by England women�s coach Mark Robinson, took five for 26 with her off-spin and then struck an unbeaten 50 as her side cantered to victory with 18.1 overs to spare.It is the first time in 50-over international women's cricket that a player has scored a half-century and taken five wickets in the same match.Chasing 166 to win at the Fischer County Ground in a match originally scheduled for Monday but delayed because of a waterlogged outfield, England cantered home by seven wickets after Kent opener Tammy Beaumont made an international career-best score of 70.She was caught at mid-on in a miscued attempt to hit Asmavia Iqbal's medium pace over midwicket, her only real scare came when she was almost run out on 49, sent back by Knight after setting off for a single.Her partnership with Knight added 96 in 20 overs for the third wicket as England enjoyed the best batting conditions of the day. Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistan�s 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameen�s 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidra�s maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs against Pakistan and will look to go 2-0 up in three-match series when the teams meet again at Worcester on Wednesday.",6/22/2016,,

sports,Sad end for Ibrahimovic as Belgium adv,"strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic's international career ended in a damp squib when Sweden lost 1-0 to Belgium in their final Euro 2016 Group E match on Wednesday and failed to reach the last 16.</strongRadja Nainggolan's fine shot after 84 minutes sent Belgium into the knockout stages and a game against Hungary as they finished second in the standings, level on six points with group winners Italy.The Swedes ended bottom on one point and Ibrahimovic's bold promise that he would never finish with a disappointment proved to be mistaken.He tried in vain to inspire his team and had a second-half effort ruled out for offside but Belgium, without ever producing their most fluent football, had enough quality to deal with Sweden's sporadic attacks and create opportunities of their own.""Zlatan has done a lot of important things in his career and would have wanted to go further here,"" Belgium captain and man-of-the-match Eden Hazard told reporters.""It was a difficult match, complicated for our defenders. In the first half we had some possession and created chances. Nainggolan scored an important goal and from then on we had to manage the game.""Sweden started brightly and Marcus Berg's fierce snap shot was parried away by Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Belgium responded with a surging run by midfielder Kevin de Bruyne that set up Romelu Lukaku for a shot just wide and a mazy dribble across the edge of the area by Hazard ended with a De Bruyne strike on goal.Ibrahimovic sprung into life with a shot just past the post but it was a rare attacking foray by Sweden who were pushed back deep by the strong-running Belgian midfield.De Bruyne whipped in two dangerous crosses from the left and from one of them Thomas Meunier flashed a header narrowly wide just before halftime.Sweden enjoyed a good spell of possession after the interval and Ibrahimovic hooked the ball into the net from close range but the effort was ruled out for offside.De Bruyne tested goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson with a fierce long-range strike and after Sweden cleared another dangerous cross the ball fell to midfielder Nainggolan whose rasping 20-metre shot flew into the top corner of the net.Ibrahimovic threw the ball away in frustration as the Belgian players celebrated and Sweden's talismanic captain cut a forlorn figure after the final whistle as he slowly walked over to applaud his team's yellow-clad fans.""I�m very disappointed,"" Sweden coach Erik Hamren said.""We were talking before the game about the honour of representing Sweden and of being here but I couldn�t have asked for much more from my players.

The game will be a repeat of last year's final in Santiago that the host nation won on penalties.The reigning champions came into the game on a high after beating Mexico 7-0 and took only six minutes to make their mark again.Former Chelsea midfielder Cuadrado misdirected a header across his own goal straight to Charles Aranguiz and the Leverkusen midfielder had the straightforward task of sidefooting past David Ospina.Chile doubled their lead four minutes later after an Alexis Sanchez shot rebounded off the post into the path of Jose Pedro Fuenzalida.With Ospina beaten, the Universidad Catolica full back scored one of the easiest goals of his career by sidefooting into the empty net.Chile, who were already missing midfielders Arturo Vidal and Marcelo Diaz, lost Pedro Pablo Hernandez after half an hour when he limped off injured and the resulting reshuffle took the wind out of their sails.Colombia came back into the game, with James Rodriguez coming close with two shots and creating chances for Roger Martinez and Edwin Carmona.However, Claudio Bravo was in fine form and it stayed 2-0 at the break.Colombia pushed on after the restart with a lively Rodriguez leading the attack but were dealt a huge blow in the 56th minute when influential midfielder Carlos Sanchez was sent off for a second yellow card offence.Colombia did not give up and came close on several occasions but conditions underfoot were difficult for both sides and the score remained 2-0.The Andean side will now play hosts United States in the third-fourth place playoff on Saturday.Argentina beat the United States 4-0 on Tuesday night to reach their second consecutive Copa America final.",6/23/2016,,

I believe we are better than that.""England have not got past the quarter-finals in their last three European Championships and failed to make it out of the group stage at the World Cup in 2014, but Rooney sees cause for optimism this time round.""If this was four years ago and you were saying you have to play France, Spain and Germany you would have been worried,"" he added.""I think the gap has changed, and not just with ourselves, but with the likes of Wales. The gap to get to those teams is not as big.""Manager Roy Hodgson's men are aiming for their first major international title since the 1966 World Cup, but will have to find a way past an inspired Iceland in the round of 16 game on Monday. They could face France for a spot in the last four.Hodgson took six strikers to France, but his team have struggled to turn dominance into goals, scoring three times in three group games and winning only one.Despite the team's struggles in the final third, Rooney, who has been pulling the strings from a deeper midfield position, said the talent in the side meant he felt less pressure to deliver.""I have always gone into a tournament thinking if I don't play at my best I cannot see us winning it,"" said the player who burst on to the international stage as an 18-year old with four goals at Euro 2004.Rooney has since failed to make a telling impact at the continental championship and though he is yet to open his account in France, he is pleased that the England squad have the talent to ease the burden of expectation on his shoulders.""I have come into this tournament and we have several players capable of doing magical things.

""The mindset ...

It's amazing.""With seven-times Wimbledon champion Federer finally starting to succumb to injuries at the age of 34, he missed the French Open after 65 consecutive majors, his chances of snatching back the trophy from Djokovic seem to be receding.Although writing him off a year after his mesmerising semi-final defeat of Murray would be foolhardy.Rafael Nadal is missing with a wrist injury, which leaves Murray as the main threat, especially now he has Ivan Lendl back in his coaching corner -- the man who guided the Scot to his two victories in grand slam finals, both against Djokovic.World number two Murray warmed up with a fifth title at Queen's Club where he beat Canada's Milos Raonic in the final.McEnroe, who is working with men's sixth seed Raonic at Wimbledon got a close-hand view of Murray at Queen's and was impressed with what he saw.""Murray is playing great. He's obviously put himself in position numerous times,"" McEnroe said. ""But at the moment there's no question that the level that Novak is at is something that you rarely, if ever, see.""With McEnroe in Raonic's box, eight-times major champion Lendl working with Murray again, Boris Becker plotting for Djokovic and now Richard Krajicek fine-tuning Stan Wawrinka's grasscourt game, the battle of the super-coaches looks like being as compelling as the on-court action.Wawrinka, seeded four at Wimbledon, has never been past the quarter-finals at the All England Club, but has proved previously that he can beat Djokovic -- as has Japan's Kei Nishikori who will be seeded five.While Djokovic stands in a league of his own and Murray is positioned ahead of the pack, there are signs that a new generation could soon be breaking up the status quo.Austrian Dominic Thiem, a French Open semi-finalist and winner on grass in Stuttgart where he beat Federer recently, will be seeded eighth while Australian Nick Kyrgios, quarter-finalist two years ago, will be dangerous at 15.Germany's Alex Zverev also beat Federer in Halle last week.""Thiem, Zverev, these guys can see light at the end of the tunnel.�It's an exciting time for men's tennis,"" McEnroe said.",6/24/2016,,

sports,Hales and Roy power England to record breaking ten wicket wi,"BIRMINGHAM: An England record opening partnership of 256 between Alex Hales and Jason Roy led their side to a crushing 10-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second one-day international in Birmingham on Friday.Hales scored 133 not out and Roy an unbeaten 112 in England�s highest first-wicket partnership in one-day cricket and they overhauled Sri Lanka�s 254 for seven with more than 15 overs to spare.It is just the sixth such victory England have achieved in their ODI history and the highest score against which any side has achieved it. It is the fifth time Sri Lanka have been defeated by ten wickets in an ODI.Their stand was not only a record for England's opening pair - overhauling Vikram Solanki and Marcus Tresocthick's 200 partnership against South Africa in 2003 - but the highest for any wicket in ODIs by England batsmen. Previously, Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott - who put on 250 together against Bangladesh here in 2010 - held the record.England lead the five-match series 1-0 after the first match in Nottingham was tied.Sri Lanka opted to bat after winning the toss but their total always looked inadequate on a good batting pitch at Edgbaston as England took wickets at regular intervals.Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews shared a fourth-wicket stand of 82 to give their side a platform.Mathews fell for 44, however, and Chandimal was run out for 52 by Roy who had earlier produced a brilliant piece of fielding to run out Kusal Perera.Upul Tharanga struck an unbeaten 53 to give Sri Lanka hope but England�s bowlers maintained a tight grip throughout, leg-spinner Adil Rasheed the pick of the attack with figures of 2-34 from 10 overs.Hales and man-of-the-match Roy were completely in command against a toothless Sri Lanka attack.Hales smashed six sixes and 10 fours while Roy went to his second one-day international century with his fourth six before driving Seekkuge Prasanna to the cover boundary to seal victory.The third match of the series is in Bristol on Sunday.�",6/25/2016,,
sports,West Indies topple South Africa in Tri nation seri,"BRIDGETOWN,� Barbados: Darren Bravo�s third hundred and impressive fast bowling from Shannon Gabriel propelled the West Indies to a comprehensive 100-run victory over South Africa in the ninth and final preliminary match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International Series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Friday.Bravo�s stroke-filled 102 anchored an impressive recovery from 21 for four to lift the West Indies to 285 all out off 49.5 overs batting first.Gabriel, in just his second ODI, then tore through the Proteas� vaunted top-order, taking the wickets of Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and captain A.B. de Villiers in the space of four fearsome overs.It was a setback from which they never recovered, eventually being dismissed for 186 off 46 overs despite a last-wicket partnership of 51 between Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. Sunil Narine ensured there would be no escape for the South Africans after Gabriel�s early blast, the spinner taking three for 28 off ten overs.With their second win in three matches against the Proteas in the tournament, the hosts advance to face World Cup-holders Australia in the final on Sunday at the same venue. It is also the first time in ten years that South Africa have failed to reach the final of a tri-nation ODI series.Of concern for the West Indies looking ahead to the final though will be the fitness of Gabriel, who left the field nursing a right leg injury after claiming the impressive figures of three for 17 from five overs of extreme pace. He should have also snared the wicket of Hashim Amla but wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin missed the straightforward opportunity offered by the prolific opener.West Indies were themselves rocked back at 21 for four when pacer Kagiso Rabada led the assault after de Villiers chose to field. However Bravo�s third one-day century, embellished with 12 fours and four sixes off 103 deliveries, proved invaluable. He found an able partner in Kieron Pollard, who curbed his usual all-out aggression in compiling 62 off 71 balls.Their fifth-wicket stand of 156 was a new West Indian record for the wicket against South Africa and wrested the initiative from the visitors who did not help their cause with characteristically untidy cricket in the field, fast-medium bowler Morne Morkel delivering six of the 17 wides conceded by the Proteas.Morkel�s nine overs cost 68 runs yet for all that indiscipline, he should have still claimed the important wicket early on of Bravo who, on 11, top-edged an attempted hook only for Wayne Parnell to misjudge the catch at fine-leg and parry the ball over the boundary rope.Imran Tahir, who routed the West Indies in their last meeting in St Kitts with record-breaking figures of seven for 45, was kept wicketless through his ten overs for the first time in ODI cricket against these opponents.South Africa�s bowling star without doubt was Rabada, whose returns of three for 31 were highlighted by a devastating opening burst after Parnell had removed Andre Fletcher in his opening over.Generating tremendous pace, Rabada induced an edge from the other opener, Johnson Charles, for Chris Morris to take a comfortable catch at second slip. He then uprooted Marlon Samuels� off-stump first ball to have the West Indies tottering at 12 for three.Ramdin avoided the hat-trick but subsequently succumbed to the lethal hostility of the 21-year-old fast bowler, first ducking into a short ball to take a blow on the back of the helmet before being comprehensively bowled off the next delivery.Bravo and Pollard then countered the rampant South Africans with determination and forceful strokeplay before the big-hitting all-rounder was caught at long-on off the suffering Morkel.Morris claimed three wickets at the end of the innings with West Indies captain Jason Holder (40) and Carlos Brathwaite (33 not out) pushing the home side to a challenging final total.",6/25/2016,,

sports,Djokovic focused on Wimbledon defence but sees bigger pictur,"strong>LONDON: On court Novak Djokovic is taking tennis to extraordinary new levels with his single-minded obsession with winning; off it the Serbian is more than happy to share power.</strongThe 29-year-old will begin his attempt to win a fourth Wimbledon title on Monday when he plays British wildcard James Ward on Centre Court -- 12 months after claiming a second successive title by beating Roger Federer.While nothing will distract him from that goal, the dominant Serbian also knows that, however big the gap is between himself and his rivals -- and it is a yawning chasm -- no player is bigger than the sport.At his pre-tournament news conference at Wimbledon on Sunday, the world number one confirmed he had re-joined the 12-man ATP Players' Council, along with chief rival Andy Murray and Murray's brother Jamie, the world's top doubles player.It is a responsibility Djokovic will apply himself to with the same devotion as his career for the next two years as tennis wrestles with the kind of doping and corruption scandals that have afflicted world sport.""I've been very flattered and humbled to be elected by my colleagues,"" Djokovic told reporters.""The way I see it is that I managed to gain trust from players, which is very important to me. I have been part of the Player Council for three years earlier in my career.�I've been familiar with the way the system works.""I'm hoping I can contribute to the evolution and to the betterment of our sport in every aspect.""There is little argument that he has taken tennis to new levels of perfection since losing to Murray in the 2013 final here.Since then he has won six of the 11 grand slam titles on offer, taking his tally to 12 overall.In beating Murray at Roland Garros earlier this month he became the first man in 47 years to hold all four majors.He also won the ATP World Tour Finals in November and will have his eye on Olympic gold in August and probably the Davis Cup too.His immediate focus though is on a smooth opening to his Wimbledon campaign having chosen again not to play any grasscourt tournaments in the run-up.""This year is quite different from previous years because I'm coming in with a Roland Garros title,"" he said.""That gives me, obviously, a lot of confidence. I've played a lot of points in the practice sessions these four or five days, trying to be on the grass as much as I can. So I'm really keen on getting on the court.""Djokovic, who beat Federer in the last two Wimbledon finals, could face a tough path to a hat-trick.Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic is a potential quarter-final opponent with Federer possible in the semis.Ward is unlikely to pose too many problems, although Djokovic is well aware that the crowd will be rooting for his opponent when play begins on Monday.""It's going to be the first match on the untouched grass,"" he said. "" That's probably one of the most special tennis matches that you get to experience as a tennis player.""I'm looking forward to that.�Obviously I know that he doesn't have much to lose.""",6/26/2016,,
sports,Griezmann double sends France into Euro 2016 last eig,"strong>LYON: Hosts France came from behind to beat 10-man Ireland 2-1 and reach the Euro 2016 quarter-finals after two second-half strikes from forward Antoine Griezmann at Parc OL on Sunday.</strongA tactical switch from coach Didier Deschamps at the break revitalised the French, who struggled to find their feet early on after conceding a Robbie Brady penalty in the second minute, the fastest goal in the 2016 tournament.France will play either England or Iceland at the Stade de France next Sunday.""We have difficulties getting into games, we saw that again today, and that's something we have to work on,"" said Griezmann.""Finding ourselves trailing made it difficult but we showed we've got heart. Things were said in the dressing room at halftime and in the second half, it was a different France team.""It was the worst possible start for the hosts when midfielder Paul Pogba clumsily barged over Ireland's Shane Long in the penalty area, allowing Brady to dispatch the resulting spot kick to go 1-0 up on the second minute.Finding themselves behind for the first time in the tournament, the hosts seemed to lack the urgency to wrestle control of a stop-start first half.Their best chances fell to Griezmann who headed over the bar from close range, while a late strike by Dimitri Payet whacked into the Irish defence who desperately guarded their goal.strong>SURGING RUN</strongAt the other end, Ireland didn't really threaten apart from a bouncing shot from striker Daryl Murphy that forced keeper Hugo Lloris to dive to his left.A flat first half ended with the French players trudging off to the noise of loud booing from the packed home support.Deschamps switched things up after the break, bringing on flying winger Kingsley Coman for holding midfielder N'Golo Kante and moving playmaker Pogba into the middle and Griezmann into a more central role behind strike partner Olivier Giroud.The strategy paid dividends immediately as France stretched a tiring Ireland. Griezmann equalised in the 58th minute from a Bacary Sagna cross, and then fired his team in front three minutes later when Giroud nodded the ball down into his path.Another surging run from Griezmann saw him chopped down on the edge of the area by Shane Duffy, earning the defender a red card as the game started to look beyond the Irish.All was forgiven by the French crowd, who broke into a deafening 'Marseillaise' and cheered their team all the way to their first knockout stage win in the competition since winning Euro 2000.On a bum note, though, Kante and defender Adil Rami picked up yellow cards and will miss the quarter final through suspension.",6/26/2016,,

sports,Thurman edges Porter to retain WBA ti,"NEW YORK: Keith Thurman put his stamp on the deeply talented welterweight division Saturday, beating challenger Shawn Porter by a unanimous decision to retain his World Boxing Association title.Thurman kept his undefeated record alive and showed he deserves to be regarded as the kingpin of the welterweight division, which is moving on from the retirements of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.The 27-year-old Thurman landed several solid lefts that either wobbled or staggered Porter as he won the close contest at the Barclays Center arena in New York by scores of 115-113 on all three judges scorecards.<br/> ""Defense, defense, defense,"" said Thurman who improved to 27-0 with 22 knockouts.The clash between two Americans was supposed to be held earlier this year, but Thurman was involved in a car crash on a rain-slicked Florida street which pushed the bout back three months.Thurman, who has been on fringes of boxing celebrity, is hoping this is a breakthrough moment for him as the former champion Porter proved to be the biggest test of his career to date.Former IBF welterweight champ Porter lost the first 12-round fight of his career.Porter figured he had done enough to wrestle the title away and some in the crowd agreed with him, booing the scores when they were announced <br/> ""I thought I won the fight. But I am satisfied because the competitor came out. We need that rematch,"" Porter said.Thurman said after the slugfest he is willing to give Porter another chance.<br/> ""He�s a great warrior,"" Thurman said. ""But I knew defense would be key.<br/> ""I was able to rock him at least once each round with clear effective blows and I believe that was the key to victory.""Thurman did most of his damage with his left while Porter had his jab working effectively.Thurman buckled Porter�s knees with a left hook in the fourth round and landed another left on the button in the 10th when Porter walked into a punch./> Thurman suffered a cut over his left eye in the ninth, the first time he has been cut in his career.Porter landed more jabs (59-32), but Thurman threw more power punches (203-177).",6/26/2016,,
sports,Colombia down US to grab Copa third ,"GLENDALE, United States: AC Milan striker Carlos Bacca scored the only goal as Colombia defeated the United States 1-0 to clinch third place in the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.Bacca, 29, bundled home the winner on 31 minutes, nudging in from close range to settle a hard-fought contest.The US, beaten 4-0 by Argentina in the semi-finals on Tuesday, rallied desperately to get back into the game but ultimately were frustrated by some superb goalkeeping from David Ospina.It was the second time the US had been beaten by Colombia in this tournament.The Colombians also defeated them 2-0 in the tournament�s opening match.Colombia had gone closest to scoring first, Real Madrid star James Rodriguez being denied by a fine Tim Howard save on 12 minutes.Rodriguez was the architect for Colombia�s goal just after the half hour mark, chipping a wonderful pass into the path of Santiago Arias, who headed across the six yard box for Bacca to score.The US responded gamely to the setback however, with Jermaine Jones almost equalising when his low shot deflected off Arias and just missed the target.Seattle Sounders veteran Clint Dempsey, arguably the best US player of the tournament, had another good game but was unable to add to his Copa tally of three goals and three assists.Dempsey almost laid on a goal for Hamburg�s Bobby Wood, but the Bundesliga-based striker was unable to get his shot away cleanly.Dempsey produced the best American chance of the second half, with his long-range curling free-kick drawing a brilliant save from Ospina, clawing the ball away one-handed as it rocketed towards the top corner.The final of the Copa America takes place on Sunday, with Argentina facing Chile in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",6/26/2016,,

Pelle volleyed in a deflected cross in injury time to complete Spain�s heartbreak.After crashing out of the World Cup in the first round, Vicente del Bosque�s team have now failed to get to the Euro quarter finals.A series of De Gea saves kept Spain in the game, but their quest for an unprecedented third consecutive Euro title peetered out as Gianluigi Buffon saved from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique late on to set up a mouthwatering quarter-final clash with Germany on Saturday in Bordeaux.Spain had lost just one of their previous 11 meetings with Italy, including a 4-0 win in the Euro 2012 final. But the Azzurri were by far the better side in the opening 45 minutes and could have been more than one goal up at the break.De Gea had been much-criticised for his performance as Spain�s 15-game unbeaten in the Euros came to an end on Tuesday with a 2-1 defeat to Croatia which cost them top spot in Group D.However, the Manchester United stopper more than made amends when he turned Pelle�s bullet header wide on eight minutes.Emanuele Giaccherini�s acrobatic effort was then turned onto the post by De Gea, albeit referee Cuneyt Cakir had already blown for a foul as Italy continued to dominate the early exchanges.It took Spain 28 minutes to even have an effort on goal as Iniesta�s weak shot was straight at Buffon.Antonio Conte�s side finally made the breakthrough 12 minutes before half-time when Spain captain Sergio Ramos unncessarily dived in on Pelle to concede a free-kick on the edge of the box.Eder�s powerful effort was parried by De Gea only as far as Giaccherini and he nudged the ball into Chiellini�s path to bundle home.strong>- Saving grace -</strongOnly a De Gea wonder save to tip a fiercely dipping drive from Giaccherini over kept Spain in the game before half-time.Spain coach Vicente del Bosque introduced the more physical presence of 35-year-old striker Aritz Aduriz for Nolito at the break.And it nearly paid dividends straight away as Alvaro Morata -- kept quiet in the first 45 minutes by former Juventus teammates Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci -- headed a golden chance straight at Buffon.De Gea was called upon once more to block from Eder when the Brazilian-born Inter Milan forward burst clear on goal with the chance to double Italy�s advantage.Another Italy counter-attack then caused chaos in the Spanish defence as Mattia de Sciglio�s low cross ricocheted around the box before being cleared.Aduriz swept the ball wide and Ramos headed over from a corner as Italy began to settle on their one-goal lead in the final quarter.Iniesta�s rasping volley was tipped over by Buffon, before Pique�s long-range effort stung the palms of the 38-year-old.However, with Aduriz having to be replaced by Pedro Rodriguez due to a head knock, Spain didn�t have a recognised striker in their search for an equaliser in the final 10 minutes.Italy comfortably held on and Pelle doubled the lead with his poacher�s strike in the first minute of injury time.",6/27/2016,,

Next over, Mendis completed a second ODI fifty with the 78th run of the innings, but then his panache forged his downfall. Attempting to repeat his pulled six against a taller, faster Plunkett, Mendis managed only to put the ball in the palms of deep square leg.Chandimal assumed a more positive outlook as he and Mathews manoeuvred Sri Lanka away from 88 for 3. Mathews ventured a low, straight six off Plunkett in the 26th over, but Adil Rashid's legspin was the more frequent victim of the pair's belligerence. The seamers returned the pair to a more measured approach, though they did continue to score smartly enough, relative to the situation: their 80-run stand was the heftiest in Sri Lanka's innings, and came off 87 balls.Having set themselves up at a reasonable 165 for 3 after 35 overs, the following ten overs were a period of significant decline. Chandimal, then Seekkuge Prasanna, were out in consecutive overs, both caught aiming swipes across the line. Mathews moved to his second half-century in three games in the company of Upul Tharanga, but top-edged a leg-side heave off Jordan to depart for 56 off 67 in the 44th over. Though the match situation was well-poised for Dasun Shanaka to showcase his hitting range, yet he attempted a non-existent single to short third man, and found himself run out cheaply again, by a sharp Joe Root.Tharanga then made the best of having to bat with the tail. He cobbled together a 33-ball 40, while Woakes in particular bowled expertly to his field, at the death. He took out the top of Tharanga's middle stump with his final ball, before Sri Lanka's last-wicket pair swung optimistically through the final over.�",6/27/2016,,
sports,Australia beat West Indies to claim tri nation seri,"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: A match-winning three-wicket bowling stint by Mitchell Marsh lifted Australia to a convincing victory by 58 runs against West Indies in the final of the triangular one-day international (ODI) series in Barbados on Sunday.Australia, who batted first after winning the toss, seemed destined to post a middling target until wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, batting at number seven, rattled off an unbeaten 57 off 52 balls.He finished his stint at the crease in style with a towering six over mid wicket off the final ball as the visitors scored 270 for nine from their allotted 50 overs.The Windies made a breezy start in reply as openers Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher put on a quick 49, with Charles scoring the lion�s share of the runs at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.But the floodgates opened after Fletcher (9) was caught at slip off paceman Josh Hazlewood, as medium-pacer Marsh collected three quick wickets to turn the match decisively and inexorably in Australia�s direction.Marsh dismissed Darren Bravo (6) and Marlon Samuels (6) cheaply, before trapping Charles (45) plum leg-before-wicket to leave the Windies staggering at 72 for four.Marsh finished with 3-32 off 10 miserly overs, while Hazlewood (5-50) mopped up the tail as the home team were all out for 212 after 48.4 overs.The result cements Australia�s number one ODI ranking, while eighth-ranked West Indies might take some consolation from reaching the final ahead of South Africa, the other team in the 10-match series.Hazlewood was named man of the series for his 11-wicket haul.Next up for West Indies is a four-Test home series against India starting on July 21, while Australia start a three-Test series in Sri Lanka on July 26.",6/27/2016,,

He has two magic feet and I'm happy for him that it led to a goal. He always gives for the side and I'm happy for him,"" Gomez said of the Vfl Wolfsburg winger, who was instructed to take on his man by Loew.Draxler added: ""He (Loew) gave me a lot of self-confidence, trusted me and wanted me to search for a lot of one-on-ones.""I think we were superior and well deserving of a victory. It was nice to be in front after the goal by Boateng. We could even afford not to score the penalty.""strong>DEFLECTED VOLLEY</strongComfortable with either foot, Draxler utilised his speed and intelligence to good effect throughout, helping his side pin the Slovaks in their own half for much of the opening period.Boateng opened the scoring with a deflected volley following a corner and ran to celebrate with team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who helped him recover from a muscle injury sustained in their last group game with Northern Ireland.Ozil's weak penalty, well saved by Matus Kozacik, was one of the few blemishes in an otherwise superb Germany performance.Slovakia may have got the better of the Germans in a pre-Euro 2016 friendly but, apart from a few forays forward, they were all at sea.Five minutes before halftime Juraj Kucka forced a flying save from Germany captain Manuel Neuer as he sent Peter Pekarik's cross toward the top corner.Germany hit back immediately, Draxler turning Kucka inside out before squaring for Gomez to stab the ball home from close range to make it 2-0.Slovakia were marginally better in the second half but when the excellent Draxler hooked a volley into the top corner in the 63rd minute there was no way back.",6/27/2016,,

They were dominant throughout at Stadium de Toulouse after Toby Alderweireld headed them into a 10th minute lead.The Red Devils wasted a series of great chances to put the game to bed before Michy Batshuayi with his first touch as a substitute, Hazard and Yannick Carrasco scored in the last 12 minutes.Belgium now meet Wales in Lille looking for a place in the semi-finals, but on the back of this promising performance coach Marc Wilmots will be looking for improvements in front of goal.<br/>Hungary impressively won their group but if they struck any fear into the hearts of Belgium�s players, it did not show.From Kevin De Bruyne�s speculative fourth-minute strike that sailed Gabor Kiraly�s crossbar, the Red Devils were too hot for a Hungary making their return to a major tournament three decades after the 1986 World Cup.Almost from kick-off, Kiraly was kept busy as Romelu Lukaku, then De Bruyne, after Hazard�s superb delivery, tested the goalkeeper.When Adam Lang hauled De Bruyne to the ground on the left flank, the Manchester City forward promptly dished out the punishment with a superb inswinging free-kick thatAlderweireld headed past Kiraly at his back post. The opener settled Belgian nerves and Hazard in particular dazzled fans with some mazy runs, dribbles, and sublime passes that carved open the Hungarian defence.Despite their attractive football, a lack of clinical finishing left Belgium at risk during an encouraging Hungary fightback in the second half.Kiraly did well to block De Bruyne�s effort with his feet after he powered on to Lukaku�s sweeping pass behind the Hungarian defence.But De Bruyne headed Lukaku�s perfectly-weighted chip into Kiraly�s arms. And when Zoltan Gera gave possession away cheaply in midfield, Lukaku�s one-two with Radja Nainggolan saw the Everton striker skew wide as De Bruyne ran in unmarked at the back post.Dries Mertens won a free kick when he was charged from behind by Tamas Kadar but De Bruyne�s superbly-struck free kick bounced off Kiraly�s crossbar.The best of Hungary�s few chances came just before the interval when midfielder Gergo Lovrencsics let fly a rasping drive that sailed just over.Moments later, Thibaut Courtois was at full stretch when Balazs Dzsudzsak fired between Nainggolan�s legs.Belgium spurned another chance on the stroke of half-time when Mertens� close-range shot was deflected by Adam Lang.Immediately after the restart, Kiraly palmed over Hazard�s right-footed drive, but Hungary came fighting back. Striker Adam Szalai fired into the side-netting before rising above the Belgian defence to send a deflected header wide.Adam Pinter�s deflected lob forced Courtois to tip over, and then Roland Juhasz heading well wide from the resulting corner.But Belgium responded in style.Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to punish Hungary when he ran in unmarked after the hour to first-time his shot past Kiraly.The �keeper was then left clutching at thin air when Hazard ran across the edge of the area unchallenged to beat him at his far post.Carrasco added their fourth in the first minute of added on time when he powered down the middle on the counter to beat Kiraly.",6/27/2016,,

How we do it is secondary,"" Martino said.<br/>""The only thing to worry about now is winning tomorrow�s game. The people want it, the players all want it, we all want it.""And that�s why we�re willing to give our all to turn around last year�s result.""<br/>Argentina were beaten on penalties by Chile in last year�s final in Santiago after 120 minutes finished level at 0-0./><strong>'Can�t lose another�</strongAsked what conclusions he had taken from last year�s defeat, Martino replied: ""What we can�t do is lose another final. That�s the biggest conclusion to draw.""Messi, meanwhile, said Argentina had emerged a stronger team as a result of the various setbacks they had suffered in recent years.""We have grown a lot as a team in the past year, and as a result we are stronger,"" Messi said.<br/>""We�ve been in spectacular form up to now. Now it�s up to us to do it again on Sunday. We don�t feel any pressure. We�re used to playing in finals -- unfortunately we haven�t won one yet.""Messi, who became Argentina�s all-time leading goalscorer with his 55th international goal in the semi-final win over the United States, will need to find a way through a fiercely combative Chilean side who are busily plotting another ambush.Argentina defeated Chile 2-1 during the group stage earlier this month, but have improved steadily as the tournament progressed.A 7-0 destruction of Mexico in the quarter-finals was followed by a clinical 2-0 dispatching of Colombia in the last four.""They are a team that presses you, and don�t let you play,"" Messi said in comments to reporters on Friday. ""And when they have the ball they play very well.""Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said ""La Roja"" would have a plan ready to contain Messi, making it likely that the spiky midfield qualities of Gary Medel will be deployed to keep the Argentinian captain in check.""Playing against the most transcendental player in history is going to be no easy task,"" Pizzi said on Saturday.""We�re going to use whatever weapons we can to stop our opponent�s actions, and of course, within these strategies there is the question of Messi,"" he added.Sunday�s final brings the curtain down on the first Copa America to be staged outside South America.The 16-team tournament comprising sides from throughout the Americas is being held to celebrate the centenary of the Copa America, which was first staged in 1916.",6/27/2016,,

sports,Club mentality is secret to Italy success says ,"strong>PARIS: Without the star names that have graced Italy sides in the past, coach Antonio Conte says the secret to their success at Euro 2016 has been to shun the mentality of a national team and behave like a club.</strongItaly came into the European Championship with an ageing squad shorn of standout talents and with few tipping them for success.Their tournament performances, however, have confounded expectations and a 2-0 victory over Spain on Monday propelled them into the quarter-finals, where they will face Germany in Bordeaux on Saturday.Recent Italy teams went into major tournaments with individual talents such as Mario Balotelli or Andrea Pirlo, who attracted enormous amounts of media attention.For Conte, who has a notorious emphasis on the team ethic and industry over individuality, the way to achieve success is to mould the national team around the model of a club, where a well-drilled tactical system can stifle even the best opponents.""I've always said, right from the start of my work here with the national team, that the only road we can follow if we want a bit of success is to be like a club, to be like a team that play together every week -- we cannot allow ourselves to be a selection,"" Conte told reporters following the victory over Spain at the Stade de France.""I'm happy above all for the players. It's more than a month that we've been working tactically, technically, mentally and we've been trying to surprise everybody and I think we've succeeded to some extent.""Spain, who had won the previous two European titles, were comprehensively snuffed out, barely posing a threat until the closing stages of the game.Conte feels next opponents Germany, however, could pose a greater challenge.The world champions cruised through the group stage and thumped Slovakia 3-0 to reach the last eight.""We now face the best side at the European Championship next Saturday,"" Conte said.""It's going to be very, very hard in all aspects.

sports,Messi fails to match Maradona success in Argentina shir,"strong>ARGENTINA: They were two small Argentina players with the same enormous challenge -- to meet the expectations of a soccer-mad country.</strongDiego Maradona and Lionel Messi have both proved themselves to be skillful giants on the world soccer stage despite their diminutive frames of 1.65 and 1.70 metres respectively.But, while Maradona reached the heights by lifting the World Cup, Messi's only major international honour has been Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Games, even though at club level he has won four Champions Leagues with Spanish greats Barcelona.Argentina's failure to beat Chile in the final of the Copa America Centenario in the United States, a fourth lost final with the national team for Messi, proved too much for the little magician and he chose to quit international football on Sunday.�The pressure (Messi) got from fans and media was and is very big. �Messi must continue with the Maradona legacy� is the message,� sports medicine specialist Norberto Debbag said.�The fans expect him to be leader and football star at the same time but it appears he�s not prepared for the social pressure the national team demands,� he told the Argentine website www.infobae.com.Maradona, who had so much natural skill that he would often juggle the ball during the team's warm-up with his bootlaces still undone, was always going to be a hard act to follow in an Argentina shirt.He had to be pulled out of a cesspit he fell into as a two-year-old, fought tooth-and-nail for everything he achieved and, with his immense footballing talent, led Argentina to their second World Cup triumph in 1986 in Mexico.It was rarely easy, though.�POOR RESULTSArgentina arrived in Mexico after disappointing results in warm-up games and even the country's president was trying to get coach Carlos Bilardo replaced for fear of a poor tournament but a them-and-us attitude helped steer Maradona�s team through.Argentina fans have always wanted Messi to replace him as the team's leader on such crusades, creating unbearable pressure with each failure to end a trophy drought dating back to 1993.The street-wise urchin approach that served Maradona so well does not work for Messi.Taking into account the Confederations Cup, Argentina have lost seven major finals since 1995, three of them to arch-rivals Brazil, and four since Messi's debut in 2005, including the 2014 World Cup final defeat by Germany.The man closest to the force of personality brought to the team by Maradona and former defender Oscar Ruggeri, who captained Argentina to their 13th and 14th Copa America titles in 1991 and 1993, is Javier Mascherano.But he has suffered even more than Messi with defeats in five finals from 2004.Coach Gerardo Martino brought in former Argentine rugby union international Federico Todeschini in March to help his team with their motivation.Argentina went on a run of eight straight wins, including a tournament group stage victory over Chile without an injured Messi. But for the final, they evidently needed something extra.Harmony appeared to reign in the squad, Messi came back into the team after recovering and scored a record 55th goal for his country against the United States in the semi-final.But he also had a troubled start to the build-up to the final, openly criticising the Argentine FA (AFA) over disrupted travel plans from Houston to East Rutherford in New Jersey.He then decided to stay quiet over his team�s complaints about a lack of proper support from the AFA until after the final, telling reporters: �I�ll tell you afterwards.�However, Argentina's defeat on penalties for the second time in a year to Chile has overtaken Messi's concerns for now.",6/28/2016,,

So all eyes were on the 34-year-old Swiss great as he stepped onto Centre Court where he had held the trophy aloft on seven occasions.But Federer began his 18th consecutive Wimbledon campaign with a tidy 7-6(5) 7-6(3) 6-3 victory that, while never spectacular, was relatively comfortable.He offered up not a single break point to the 51st-ranked Pella, and while he converted only one of the nine that came his way, he found an extra gear when required.Federer's only real moment of alarm came at 5-6, 0-30 in the second set. But he quickly killed the danger and waltzed through the tiebreak to take a two-set lead. With light fading he made light work of the third set.Federer's next appointment will be with British qualifier Marcus Willis, ranked 772nd in the world, on Wednesday.""It's a great, great story and I'm very, very excited to be playing him actually. It's the best story in tennis for a while,"" Federer told reporters when asked about playing Willis, a tennis coach who survived six rounds of qualifying.""It's going to be a great atmosphere.""While Federer was more than happy for Willis to take the spotlight after his win over Ricardas Berankis, he was more concerned with his own form and fitness after arriving at Wimbledon without a title in the first six months of the season for the first time since 2000.""Time heals a lot of problems, a lot of issues,"" Federer said. ""It's another day, another step in the right direction. It gives me confidence as I hopefully move forward.""I've worked as hard as I possibly could since February. My big goal was to not miss Wimbledon, to be here, hopefully at 100 percent. Don't know yet if I am.

""Hodgson should have gone in 2014, when England lasted two matches at the World Cup. He wasn't the man then, he isn't the man now.""There has been much talk of progress, promise and a strong culture of responsibility, but under pressure, that all evaporated.""While Hodgson was blamed for having a seemingly incoherent plan for the tournament with no clear idea on his strongest side or how to play the game, the players and the culture of the English Premier League were also criticised.""The reason why the nation struggles to feel empathy or connections with many of these players is the ego,"" Ian Herbert wrote in The Independent. ""Too famous, too important, too rich, too high and mighty... that is this England.""The Guardian's Dominic Fifield also criticised the more experienced players in the squad, who had not shown any leadership or stepped up to help their younger team members.""Hodgson had needed his most established players to excel if the team were going to make an impression,"" Fifield wrote. ""In the end they simply wilted like the rest.""The BBC's chief soccer writer Phil McNulty also felt the players would need to take a look at themselves under a new manager.""The ultimate responsibility lies with the manager but, make no mistake, he was badly let down by players capable of so much better,"" McNulty wrote.""Hodgson will take the blame and has paid the price but these highly paid Premier League players should not escape criticism.""",6/28/2016,,

No one player can decide the outcome of a match. Portugal have top class players throughout their team and we have to also focus on them.""But what is clear is, when they recover possession, they counter very well. They�re a dangerous team and we�re expecting a very difficult match.""strong>- Goals needed -</strongWhile Portugal hope and pray Ronaldo rises to the occasion amid an underwhelming campaign so far, the White Eagles will be hoping they can maintain the dream of going one step further, said striker Arkadiusz Milik.Despite scoring only one goal so far and facing criticism for his lack of clinical finishing, he is hoping to make amends.""There�s a lot of interest in us back home in Poland. That reflects very well on us, and we want to keep the fans dreaming,"" said Milik, whose solitary strike came in a 1-0 win over Northern Ireland.Milik and star strike partner Robert Lewandowski are under pressure to make more of their chances with Poland having scored just three times in four games.The Ajax striker revealed he has been texting former Arsenal forward Dennis Bergkamp during the tournament having forged a ""close relationship"" with the Dutch club�s assistant manager.Although he did not reveal the content, Milik is hoping to make improvements to his game.""Maybe I haven�t been as clinical in front of goal as I should have, but hopefully I�ll get some more chances,"" he said.""I don�t really care,"" about the media criticism, he added. ""I try to do my job on the pitch and try to fulfil the tactical mission the coach gives me.""Bayern Munich star Lewandowski scored 42 goals this season, but has failed to find the net in France.However, Nawalka insisted his captain was leading by example.""I�m very happy with his performances and he�s fulfilling a very important role, both as the captain for his teammates and also on the pitch.""He�s in great physical form and mentally he�s strong. He�s doing a very good job and let�s keep it that way.""Asked about the threat of Portugal and, in particular, Ronaldo, Milik said: ""We�re trying to approach it like any other match. We don�t feel extra pressure, or that we�re fighting for a semi-final place.""We know we have to do our best, and it will be the same tomorrow.""For the bookmakers, it would be a surprise for Poland to qualify, but we know our strengths and we know we�re capable of going through.""",6/29/2016,,

""There are 17 test matches in the next 12 months.""I just look at that as an opportunity to gain experience and contribute to Indian cricket.""Kumble's first assignment will be a four-test series in West Indies, after which India is set for a bumper season of home action when they will be playing 13 test matches, eight ODIs and three T20 internationals.They start with three tests against New Zealand, while England and Australia will play five and four matches respectively.

""The experiences I have had as a captain or as a player will certainly help in sharing those.""It's a different role...

sports,India New look Saina Nehwal primed Rio success Padu,"strong>MUMBAI: Saina Nehwal is better equipped to win a medal in Rio in August than the Indian shuttler was when she claimed a bronze at the London Olympics four years ago, former All England champion Prakash Padukone told Reuters.</strongHopes that the former world number one can turn bronze into a first Olympic gold medal in the sport for her country were raised when Nehwal won the Australian Superseries title.Rio will mark a third Olympics for Nehwal, who beat former world champions Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand and Wang Yihan before overpowering China's Sun Yu in the final in Sydney.""Saina has a lot more variety now,"" former men's world number one Padukone said in an interview.""I think she plays a lot more at the net now. Earlier her game was more or less predictable. She had a few strokes, she used to keep playing them and there were not many variations.""Now she has developed a lot more strokes, specially at the net. She is much more confident and that has made a big difference.""The victory in Australia came at just the right time for Nehwal, who had failed to reach a World Superseries final since last November in China and was returning from an Achilles injury she sustained at the end of last year.Padukone, who won the All England title in 1980 long before badminton was admitted to the Olympics in 1992, said the 26-year-old's game just needed a bit of tweaking.""Tactically she can do a little bit more. Maybe a plan A and plan B, which I'm sure she already has,"" said Padukone, who will be a panellist for broadcaster Star Sports during the 2016 Games. ""Maybe if something doesn't work, then she has to have a different plan.""It's just the question of a little bit of polishing. She definitely has everything otherwise she wouldn't have been where she is.""China has long been the dominant force in the sport, sweeping all five titles at London four years ago, but their shuttlers no longer top the world rankings heading to Rio.While Malaysian Lee Chong Wei tops the men's singles rankings, Carolina Marin of Spain leads the women's list with Nehwal in sixth place.World Badminton has also limited each nation to two singles entrants in each event - down from the three at London and previous Games - and Padukone feels that makes a Chinese sweep of badminton gold in Rio less likely.""They are no longer the dominating force going by the results we have seen in the last 12 to 24 months,"" Padukone said. ""Earlier when the draw used to come, everybody used to hope there are no Chinese.""That's no longer the case, that fear is not there anymore. That's good for the game. For the Indians, though they wouldn't say it, but it used to be a mind-block.""India's best chance of medals will come in the women's singles, Padukone said, where as well as Nehwal they have PV Sindhu ranked 10th in the world.Padukone said the most important thing for the Indian shuttlers was to peak during the Aug. 11-20 Rio competition.""When you go there it doesn't matter if in the last two months you have beaten all the top players and you have been the world number one,"" Padukone said.""It's important that you reach the peak and play your best during that particular week.

For Brazil's National Mint the answer is simpler: recycled silver.</strongThe 500-gram (17.6-ounce) Olympic gold medals that Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps and other athletes will be competing for in Rio de Janeiro are nearly 99 percent silver. They contain just 1.2 percent gold, mostly used as plating.""It's a great honor and a great responsibility,"" said Victor Hugo Berbert, head of medal-making, as he showed Reuters around the mint in Rio de Janeiro.Each of the 5,130 Olympic and Paralympic medals takes about 48 hours to make, said Berbert, who has an 80-strong team working shifts around the clock.The medals are the most sustainable in Olympic history. Much of the silver is recycled from old mirrors and X-ray plates. The gold is free of mercury, which is often used to separate gold from ore and can poison local ecosystems if not carefully disposed of.Nike, the winged goddess of victory in Ancient Greece, is minted on one side below the five Olympic rings, while the discipline for which the medal has been won is engraved along its edge.

sports,Preview Ronaldo poses biggest threat yet to Polish rearguard,"strong>MARSEILLE, FRANCE: Poland have an impressive defensive record at Euro 2016 but standing in their way to a semi-final spot is arguably one of sport's greatest-ever athletes, Cristiano Ronaldo.</strongThe monstrous Polish centre back pairing of Michal Pazdan and Kamil Glik face their toughest challenge yet when they come up against Portugal in the last-eight clash in Marseille on Thursday, though their previous matches have not provided much by way of preparation for facing the Real Madrid star.Describing 29-year-old Ronaldo as the ""perfect athlete"", U.S. lifestyle magazine Men's Health says he hits speeds of more than 32 kph, jumps nearly a metre in the air off one leg, runs an average of 16 km per match and hits more winners in the last 20 minutes than anyone else.He is the only player to have scored a goal in four Euros going back to 2004 and, while he struggled to find his feet early in this year's tournament, there are signs that he is back to his sublime best.He scored twice in Portugal's last group match against Hungary -- an audacious back heel and a towering header -- and has had a hand in two of his country's other three goals, most importantly the shot that set up Ricardo Quaresma to score the easiest of extra-time winners in their last-16 win over Croatia.For their part, Poland are good shotstoppers.They have conceded just three goals all year and only one in the Euros, an outrageous bicycle kick by Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri in their round-of-16 tie which they eventually won on penalties. Only Germany still have a clean sheet in Euro 2016.Poland's matches in France so far will have done little to prepare them for the pace, power and superhuman heading ability that Ronaldo possesses, however.Their top-ranked opponents to date, Germany, fielded the diminutive Mario Goetze in their group-stage stalemate and the 'false nine' presented little trouble in the box, constantly dropping back into midfield to pick up the ball.Other group matches against Northern Ireland, who did not get a decent effort on target, and Ukraine, who departed after failing to score in any of their games, were fairly straightforward.The late Shaqiri wonder goal in their last outing did unsettle the Poles, with Switzerland gaining the upper hand in extra time. But the rearguard held firm, forcing the tie to penalties.That defence will have to be immaculate again if Poland are to have a chance of progressing because they have offered little up front.They have scored two goals fewer than any other team in the last eight with hitman Robert Lewandowski, the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with 13 goals, mustering just two attempts on target so far, both in the last match.The captain's opening penalty in the shootout, which left the goalkeeper stranded as it flew into the top right corner, could be the confidence boost he needs.It is the scintillating left winger Kamil Grosicki who presents the biggest danger for Portugal's ageing but experienced defence led by 33-year-old Pepe.For Polish coach Adam Nawalka, the Ronaldo factor presents a tactical conundrum. Is he prepared to press high in search of a goal, knowing that a wrong step could unleash the Portuguese counter-attack, or does he sit back and risk becoming just a spectator to another Ronaldo masterclass?Whoever wins on Thursday will play either Wales or Belgium next, seen as the easier route to the final with hosts France, world champions Germany, Italy and surprise quarter-finalists Iceland on the other side of the draw.",6/29/2016,,

sports,Jason Roy stunning knock powers England victory,strong>LONDON: Jason Roy fell five runs short of setting a new batting record but his superb 162 still helped England win the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka and take an unassailable 2 0 series lead on Wednesday.</strongSurrey s South African born opener took centre stage on his home county ground and hammered the second highest individual one day score by an England batsman.His fireworks lit up the gloomy rain filled South London skies to ensure England captured the series at The Oval.His second hundred in three ODI games 162 runs off 118 including 13 fours and three sixes helped England clinch a six wicket win with overs to spare as they chased down their revised victory target of 308 with ease.And they clinched the series 2 0 with just one game left in Cardiff on Saturday.It was England s second highest successful one day run chase�� and they did it in 42 overs.Sadly for Roy he fell just five runs short of overtaking the highest score by an England batsman with another Robin Smith s 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston in 1993 still holding firm.He was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep with England in sight of the finishing line.Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler saw them home with 11 balls remaining.At Edgbaston Roy was accompanied by fellow opener Alex Hales who also made an unbeaten ton in that match.But this time he was helped mainly by Joe Root whose 65 showed a return to form for the Yorkshireman who had struggled recently and had gone six games with just one score over 11. But if Root had his mojo back Roy merely continued in the kind of vain which has made him one of the world s most destructive and stylish one day performers.A back injury to Alex Hales during Sri Lanka s innings of 305 5 off a reduced number of overs due to the rain meant Moeen Ali had to open with Roy instead.But Roy shrugged off the early loss of Ali for just two and the batsman cut and carved the Sri Lankan attack apart.England raced out the blocks needing more than seven an over and Roy ensured they were always up with the required rate the skies still dark and threatening to rain once more.Root departed a lazy top edged sweep saw him caught by Nuwan Pradeep off Danushka Gunathilaka and his 149 run second wicket partnership with Roy came to a sad end.Morgan looked well set until he was superbly caught by the diving Gunathilaka for 22 off Suranga Lakmal with England on 221. Roy was joined by Jonny Bairstow and reached 150 but was kicking himself when he was bowled by Pradeep with England so close to the finishing line.Earlier Sri Lanka had produced their best batting display of the series so far with four men hitting half centuries.The tourists recovered from losing opener Kusal Perera in the second over run out by Jonny Bairstow for just a single to give England s attack the run around.Morgan chose to field first and he may have been regretting it for a while as Gunathilake and Kusal Mendis put on 128 for the second wicket off just 111 balls.Mendis was struck 13 boundaries in his 77 while Gunathilaka was also aggressive with seven fours in his 62. The persistent rain finally came down hard enough to force the players from the field for a two and a half hour delay with Sri Lanka on 127 1 from 18.1 overs at the time.England fought back with Adil Rashid claiming the wickets of Mendis (77) and Gunathilaka (62) but England still had to deal with the in form Chandimal (63) and his captain Angelo Matthews (67 not out) who picked up the gauntlet.and helped Sri Lanka amass 305 5 from 42 overs.England s target was revised up by just three runs but with Roy building up a full head of steam they cruised home comfortably.,6/30/2016,,
sports,Federer plays cameo role to end Willis fairy,"strong>LONDON: Few players have reduced the great Roger Federer to a role as secondary attraction on Wimbledon's Centre Court but for one hour and 25 minutes on Wednesday he had just a walk-on part in the Marcus Willis fairytale.</strongThe seven-times champion enjoys too much deep-rooted affection at the All England Club to be cast as a real pantomime villain, but for once the cheers were all behind the 25-year-old local hero on the other side of the net.Federer's 81st Wimbledon match, of course, ended in victory.Even the most over-egged Hollywood script could not have had him losing to world number 772 Willis, whose transformation from a 30 pounds ($40.30) an hour tennis coach to Wimbledon sensation has captured the imagination of the sporting world.But the swaggering Swiss was at least made to break sweat under the closed roof before claiming a 6-0 6-3 6-4 victory.Willis had his photo taken with Federer, 34, before the warm-up and could hardly stop grinning.He even celebrated a practise serve with a raised fist as his friends went through their song-list at court side.But when Willis lost the opening set in 25 minutes without managing a game you feared the worst.strong>DEAFENING ROAR</strongSo when he did finally trouble the scoreboard, holding serve in the eighth game, the deafening roar rivalled the one heard when fellow Briton Andy Murray ended 77 years of pain by beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final.From then on the quirky left-hander's unorthodox shots kept 17-times major champion Federer guessing at times, especially his grass-hugging backhand slices and cheeky drop volleys.Federer joined in with some dazzling party pieces of his own but played largely within himself -- smiling occasionally as Willis bathed in an unfamiliar spotlight.Afterwards he paid Willis the ultimate compliment.""I'll remember most of the Centre Court matches here at Wimbledon, but this one will stand out because it's that special and probably not going to happen again for me to play against a guy 770 in the world,"" Federer told reporters.""The support he got, the great points he played. In some ways, I enjoyed it as much as I possibly could, but I also had to put my head down and focus hard to get the lead.""strong>PUSHED HARDER</strongFederer broke for a 5-2 lead in the second and closed it out two games later but was pushed harder in the third as Willis, who survived six qualifying rounds before stunning Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis in round one, kept his nose in front.Federer, moving well after missing the French Open with a back injury, looked a touch relieved when he broke at 4-4 in the third set, though, and claimed victory when Willis sliced a backhand long in the next game.""Today again, after the match, I just said he played great and I wished him the best for the rest of the year,"" Federer said. ""I said a few days ago, this story is gold.""Willis, cheered on by his parents and his girlfriend who persuaded him to continue his professional career rather than coach in the U.S., walked off with his head held high.His mates sang ""Shoes off, if you love Willis! -- a bizarre chant they started when he was beating 54th ranked Berankis.""I have had a fantastic couple of weeks. I will keep going and do what I have been doing,"" said Willis. ""There is life after Wimbledon and I want more experiences like this. I've earned myself a beer now!""",6/30/2016,,

Early in the session, he broke his front wing when he ran across the bright yellow kerbs at the exit of the penultimate corner.Speaking on team radio, he said: ""The yellow kerbs in the fast corners are really dangerous....

But I was hitting the ball clean. I was happy with how I played,"" said the world number two, who will next face Australian John Millman.Lu, affectionately known as Rendy on the tour, had handed Murray a chastening defeat in the first round of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Since then, however, the man who beat Andy Roddick to reach the 2010 Wimbledon quarter-finals has failed to win a set against the Scot in four subsequent meetings.On a comeback trail after being out of action for four months having undergone right elbow surgery in January, Lu had come into the match on an 11-match winning streak on grass after claiming two Challenger titles in the run up to Wimbledon.But despite the promising start against Murray, his luck quickly ran out.""I finished the match really well.

Boring is not a word which could be used to describe the flamboyant Ibrahimovic, who scored 50 goals in 51 matches for PSG last season.United have not yet confirmed the deal but British media reported that he will undergo a medical at Old Trafford on Friday.Ibrahimovic announced his retirement from international football last week after Sweden's early exit from Euro 2016.He will link up with his new team mates next month and could feature on the club's tour of Asia, for which they are due to depart on July 19.",7/1/2016,,
sports,Lehmann ICC intervention prevent player burnou,"strong>CANBERRA: Australia coach Darren Lehmann has urged cricket's governing body to help reduce the workload on players competing in all three forms of the game as he fears the current packed schedule is unsustainable.</strongAs the Indian Premier League (IPL) appears set to capitalise on recent International Cricket Council (ICC) changes to the schedule through a ""mini IPL"" in September, Lehmann fears such a tournament would further restrict time off for his players.In 2015, Australian cricketers who played all three formats spent on average 280 days overseas. Under Cricket Australia (CA) contracts, players are given a six-week break from commitments, which many use to sign lucrative IPL contracts.Lehmann said that while the financial incentive to play in India was tempting, it often wore players out and the ICC should use a common sense approach to future scheduling so that the toll on bodies was not too high.""If it keeps going like this, with players playing IPL as well, they are inevitably going to break down,"" Lehmann told Australian media on Friday.""Hopefully changes will happen at the ICC and then you will see a refined schedule which will be better.""Lehmann said while players often consider setting themselves up for life by playing in the IPL, it was a ""tough conundrum"" for national selectors, as they are reluctant to advise players not to take on out-of-contract commitments.""If you look across a two-year cycle, all of our players have had to come home at some point,"" he said, while referring to injuries Steve Smith (wrist) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) picked up in the most recent IPL season.Lehmann believes that while players may be primed to perform under match day stresses, it was the constant travel, variable conditions and lack of adequate rest which was putting them most at risk.""It's not so much the cricket; it's the travel to these places. You're on the road, you have training and all that stuff,"" he said.The ICC is currently considering the introduction of a two-tiered test Championship and a one-day league, which would go some way to lightening the workload.",7/1/2016,,
sports,Despair at plans for split from Test crickets newest nati,"DHAKA: Test cricket�s newest nations are in despair at plans to split the format into two divisions, fearing it could undo decades of hard-fought progress on the field and kill interest in the game.Cricket�s governing body the International Cricket Council (ICC) is meeting in Edinburgh this week to debate proposals for the seven top-ranked teams to establish a de facto premier league in a bid to boost waning interest in Tests.Under the scheme being considered by the ICC, the other three countries with Test status would join a five-strong second division along with Afghanistan and Ireland.<br/> While the shake-up would guarantee cricket�s leading nations play each other every other year, the other sides would be starved of matches which draw in crowds and lucrative broadcast deals.As things stand, the two latest arrivals at cricket�s top table -- Bangladesh and Zimbabwe -- will be doomed to the second tier and could be joined by another relative newcomer Sri Lanka.""This will spell the death of international cricket as we�ve known it,"" said Ahmed Sazzadul Alam, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director.Bangladesh lobbied for years to join cricket�s elite before playing their first Test in 2000. Their record has been poor, winning just seven of their 93 Tests and they are currently ranked ninth, just above Zimbabwe.However, performances have improved significantly of late and Bangladesh have only lost six of their last 18 Tests.BCB vice president Mahbubul Anam warned Bangladesh ""would go backwards"" if they stop playing teams such as England and India, both of whom they are due to play later this year. ""The more we play against competitive sides, the better we�ll get,"" said Anam.Alistair Campbell, a former director of Zimbabwe�s board, appreciated the arguments for a split because of the gulf in class between the top and bottom sides.But Campbell, a former captain who played in Zimbabwe�s inaugural Test against India in 1992, said it would be heartbreaking if current players would never be able to compete against the best.""It�s going to be a tragedy if you are growing up in a country like Zimbabwe or Bangladesh,"" he told AFP. ""It means you might never get the opportunity to play with top tier sides. That might drive players to go and seek greener pastures.""There are similar fears in Sri Lanka which has fallen down the rankings in the last two years after batting greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene retired.<br/> Sri Lanka are currently ranked seventh and in danger of being overtaken by an improving West Indies by the time the proposed split comes into force.Sri Lanka also struggled in the first decade after their inaugural Test in 1982 but then found their feet and won the 1996 World Cup.Sidath Wettimuny, who scored Sri Lanka�s first Test century, warned the architects of the split were playing with fire.""It�s okay to make some tweaks but what is proposed is going to be a disaster in every sense of the word,"" he said.Sri Lankan board�s secretary Mohan de Silva was cool on the proposal. ""We are not very much in favour, but we need to discuss with our executive committee after studying it carefully before taking a final decision,"" he wrote in a text from Scotland.But Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera insisted the shake-up should be opposed as it would ""have a negative impact"".Sri Lanka�s cash-strapped board is hugely dependent on TV money and ticket revenue from tours by the likes of India and Australia. But neither broadcasters nor spectators will pay significant amounts for matches involving minnows such as Ireland.""If you club the weakest teams in one league, who�ll be interested in watching those games? This will lead to financial ruin,"" Jayasekera told AFP.The BCB�s Alam also warned of dire financial consequences. ""There would be an inevitable loss of interest among younger followers of and a decline in interest from the media and sponsors,"" he said.""The resulting downturn in revenues would undermine development programmes and funding of domestic leagues�.

It was confirmed by the team that the German suffered a suspension failure.Rosberg appeared to be pushing for a fast lap on a new set of ultra-soft tyres - on which both Mercedes men have struggled for performance - as he came out of Turn Two.Hamilton had followed him out also on ultra-softs as Rosberg�s Mercedes showed heavy left rear wheel vibrations as he ran wide across the kerb.He seemed to be clear of the controversial yellow �baguette� kerbs that were criticised so severely on Friday by Verstappen.Rosberg�s car appeared to suffer a suspension failure and he was thrown into a spin that saw him crash off the barriers on the left off the track before coming to a halt.He was unhurt, but the session was red-flagged to a halt for 10 minutes during which the debris was cleared and an angry Rosberg gave vent to his feelings, waving his arms in frustration in the Mercedes garage.His accident demonstrated clearly how difficult Mercedes were finding it to manage the ultra-soft tyres and extract good performance.On re-start, Hamilton went out and clocked a lap in 1:07.7 to jump to fourth on the monitors, some way off the pace set by Vettel who did 1:07.098, another outright lap record at the Red Bull Ring.In a final flurry of action, Hamilton kept off the kerbs and rose to fourth and then third before the chequered flag.Rosberg�s misfortune may have handed Hamilton a chance to cut his team-mate�s 24-point lead in the title race if he can take advantage in qualifying scheduled to take place later Saturday.",7/2/2016,,

sports,Sprinters to shine at start of climbers Tour,"Le Mont-Saint-Michel, France: Reigning champion Chris Froome says this year�s Tour de France is made for the specialist climbers, but it begins on Saturday with a flat stage favouring sprinters.Saturday�s �Grand Depart� takes place at the picturesque tourist resort of Mont Saint-Michel, before finishing 188km later at Utah Beach, made famous as one of the main sites of the Normandy Landings during World War II.One of the big favourites for the opening stage is German sprint king Marcel Kittel, back at the Tour after a one-year injury and illness induced hiatus.Having won the opening stage in 2013 and 2014, Kittel is gunning for a hat-trick, but he knows it will be tough.The other main favourite is his countryman Andre Greipel, who won four stages last year in Kittel�s absence.Neither Englishman Mark Cavendish, who is third on the all-time list of Tour stage wins with 26, nor world champion Peter Sagan of Slovakia can be discounted.A breakaway group will likely animate the first stage, but the sprinters� teams will never let them far off the leash and will take no chances in reeling them before setting up a fast, furious and perhaps manic bunch finish.Two years ago, Cavendish crashed in just such a mass sprint, breaking his collarbone and being forced out of the Tour.It will take a week for the first true test of the overall contenders to arrive on the seventh stage from l�Isle-Jourdain to Lac de Payolle.From there on there will be four summit finishes, seven hors category climbs and 14 first category ones.Many people believe the overall battle will turn out to be a two-way struggle between Froome and Colombian Nairo Quintana, who finished second to the Briton in both 2013 and last year.",7/2/2016,,

It�s sweet and I�m enjoying it.""In beating Belgium, who they also defeated in qualifying, Coleman�s men surpassed the Wales greats of 1958, whose quarter-final showing at that year�s World Cup in Sweden had been the country�s best previous achievement.But they will have to do without both Ben Davies and Aaron Ramsey, who set up two of the Wales goals, after they received bookings that ruled them out of the semi-final.Belgium coach Marc Wilmots will face difficult questions about his failure to achieve more with one of his nation�s finest collections of footballers, who also fell in the last eight at the 2014 World Cup.He was missing three of his four first-choice defenders -- Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen through injury, Thomas Vermaelen through suspension -- but with no other previous tournament-winners in this half of the draw, defeat represented a massive missed opportunity.Heavy pre-match downpours in Lille heightened fears about the pitch, which was relaid just a week ago, but the slick playing surface held firm and provided the platform for an electrifying game.",7/2/2016,,
sports,Djokovic facing Wimbledon humiliation Serena Venus surviv,"LONDON: World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic was facing Wimbledon humiliation on Friday before rain saved him from his worst defeat at the tournament since 2008.The three-time champion, who is already halfway to the first calendar Grand Slam in 47 years, dropped the first two sets of his third round clash against American 28th seed Sam Querrey 7-6 (8/6), 6-1.But after just 73 minutes of action, rain sent them running for cover off Court One, giving 12-time major winner Djokovic welcome sanctuary before play was called off for the day on the outside courts. By that stage, only 17 of the scheduled 32 ties had been completed.Djokovic, who has an 8-1 record over Querrey, has made at least the quarter-finals on his last seven visits to Wimbledon since losing to Marat Safin in the second round eight years ago.He has also made the last eight of each of the last 28 Grand Slams since losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the 2009 French Open.Meanwhile, Serena and Venus Williams survived marathon duels as the rain, which has plagued the tournament, forced organisers to consider playing on the middle Sunday for the first time since 2004.World number one and defending champion Serena defeated US compatriot Christina McHale 6-7 (7/9), 6-2, 6-4 on Centre Court, only just avoiding what would have been her earliest-ever Wimbledon defeat.The six-time Wimbledon champion will face Germany�s Annika Beck for a place in the last 16.",7/2/2016,,

sports,Germany win epic shootout to end Italy jinx,"strong>Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux: Germany won an epic shootout featuring 18 penalties by 6-5 to end their jinx against Italy in major tournaments and reach the Euro 2016 semi-finals after the game finished 1-1 following extra time on Saturday.</strongJonas Hector was Germany's hero when he fired home the winning penalty, after Matteo Darmian missed for Italy, and they will now face either hosts France or Iceland in the last four.The shootout featured seven misses with some near-farcical spot kicks and was a complete contrast to the tense, tactical and highly-disciplined 120 minutes of football that preceded it.The usually clinical Germans, who had not missed in a shootout since the 1982 World Cup, failed to convert three times but still progressed thanks to even more wayward shooting by Italy who sent two kicks wide and had two saved by Manuel Neuer.Germany, who in their semi-final on Thursday, have now won their last six shootouts at major tournaments since losing to Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship final.""It's difficult to find the words. I'm overjoyed that the ball went in,"" said Hector. ""I can't describe the feeling. I took my heart in my hands and just wanted to knock it in.""Germany coach Joachim Loew added: ""I congratulated him (Hector). It was a very special situation. I had a good feeling when he was taking his (penalty) shot.""strong>BIZARRE HANDBALL</strongMesut Ozil had given Germany the lead midway through the second half before Leonardo Bonucci replied with a penalty following a bizarre handball by Jerome Boateng.Germany, who reached their sixth successive semi-final in a major tournament, had never previously beaten Italy at a major finals -- a run stretching back to the 1962 World Cup.Italy's four wins included a World Cup final and two semis and the Euro 2012 semi-final. The other four games were drawn.For Italy, the defeat was the end of the road in a campaign which has already taken them further than expected, with impressive wins over dark horses Belgium and holders Spain.Coach Antonio Conte has been credited with overcoming the lack of natural talent in his squad through tactical discipline and hard work but, with key midfielder Daniele De Rossi joining the injured list, Germany proved to be a bridge too far.""The players have left a significant mark on this tournament and shown that with desire and hard work, you can achieve something,"" said Conte.""Football can bring you joy and can leave a bad taste in your mouth. The players will always have a place in my heart.�strong>TENSE START</strongThe first half was as tense, tactical and cagey as expected between teams who had conceded one goal between at these finals.Germany's passing was slicker, though, and they went ahead the 65th minute when Hector's pass into the area was deflected off Bonucci and fell perfectly for Ozil to guide into the net.It seemed that might be enough to win the game but Italy equalised out of the blue 13 minutes later.Alessandro Florenzi curled the ball into the area, Boateng jumped to challenge Giorgio Chiellini with his arms raised like a basketball player and the ball hit the German's arm.Bonucci fired a superb penalty low into the bottom right hand corner, beyond Neuer's reach.Italy suddenly found a new lease of life as striker Graziano Pelle had a shot deflected wide following a quick break and Mattia De Sciglio fired into the side-netting.Little happened in extra time but the shootout was one of the most eventful ever seen at a major tournament.Simone Zaza, who sent his kick high and wide after an unorthodox run-up, Pelle, Bonucci and Darmian missed for Italy, while Thomas Mueller, Ozil and Bastian Schweinsteiger fluffed their lines for Germany before Hector sealed the victory.",7/3/2016,,

It followed their 235-run opening stand in the second ODI at New Road when they both hit centuries.Beaumont reached her fifty off 30 balls, and having moved to 82 with nearly five overs remaining had time to score England's first T20I century before falling lbw as she attempted a reverse-sweep, meaning Charlotte Edwards' unbeaten 92, against Australia at Hobart, remained England�s best.Like Beaumont, Winfield struck 10 fours and also a six off Sadia Yousuf and her final score equalled her career-best, having also made 74 against South Africa in 2014.At 146 for 0 in 15 overs, 200 was within reach for England but the last five overs were not quite as fluent as the first 15. The 16-20-over block had fewer runs - 41 - than the other five-over breakdowns.The final over included a team hat-trick for Pakistan as Nat Sciver edged a swipe, Danni Wyatt was run out and Heather Knight feathered a reverse-sweep to the keeper.A target of 189 was, unsurprisingly, well out of reach for Pakistan and England's bowling was not stretched in defending the target. Four of the wickets fell to full-tosses, the third of them giving 17-year-old debutant Sophie Ecclestone, a left-arm spinner, her first international wicket when Sidra Ameen picked out deep midwicket.Asmavia Iqbal struck some powerful blows to finish as top-scorer -- including the one six of the innings, which was Pakistan's first of the tour - before being bowled by Danielle Hazell in the final over.�",7/4/2016,,

What he did wasn�t good, but he served his punishment then.""It hasn�t happened and the ICC (International Cricket Council) haven�t made any big statements, but if I was in charge if you got caught once that would be it - one strike and you�re out.""England paceman Stuart Broad made his highest Test score of 169 during the now infamous match at Lord�s, an innings that was quickly overshadowed by the spot-fixing furore.However, Broad told Britain�s Mail on Sunday newspaper: ""In Amir�s case I certainly have no hard feelings about playing against him again.""What he did was wrong but he was extremely young and maybe not aware of the consequences. The reality is he�s back in the game and has served his time.""Broad added: ""I have a little bit of sympathy for Amir but once you�ve received money to do something illegal that is always a bad thing.""We are very well-educated by the ICC�s anti-corruption unit, but at 18 years old you are potentially more vulnerable and susceptible to your elders.""Broad, however, agreed with Cook that life bans were the best deterrent to spot and match-fixing.""I am strongly of the view that one of the only ways we will ever expel this awful disease from our game is to hand out lifetime bans for any kind of fixing,"" said Broad.",7/4/2016,,

I think that really helped me out a lot. I talked to Patrick. He gave me some tips on what I could do,"" she said.Kuznetsova beat Williams on a hardcourt at the Miami Open in March and, prior to the break, was more than holding her own. She frustrated the American by varying her pace well and mixing in slices and dropshots.Whatever words of wisdom Mouratoglou imparted, the six-times Wimbledon champion was too hot to handle after the break, reeling off the last eight games in a 7-5 6-0 win.The number one seed faces another Russian, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, in the quarter-finals, where she was joined for the first time since 2010 by older sister Venus.""It's great,"" the younger Williams said.

He's an example of what the team is,"" he said.Even so, the 31-year-old three-times World Player-of-the-Year has often struggled with an image problem, especially when he said two years ago that Portugal needed ""two or three Cristiano Ronaldos.""He insists on taking every free kick within - and often beyond - shooting distance, prompting suggestions that he is selfish, and is regularly captured on television cameras remonstrating angrily with his team mates.Nani, a veteran of more than 100 caps, is invariably berated if he dares to try a shot rather than feed the ball to the ""senior partner.""Earlier in the tournament Ronaldo threw a reporter's microphone into a lake when he was asked a question during a team walk and was criticised for disparaging remarks he made about Iceland after Portugal drew 1-1 with the rank outsiders in their opening match.He has not even turned up at any of the daily press conferences which Portugal hold at their camp.Bale, in comparison, has taken part in at least four, looks relaxed, and is not afraid to stir up some controversy such as when he said that no England players would get into the Wales side, adding that Wales were more passionate than their larger neighbours.Television images tend to show him encouraging his team mates rather than gesticulating angrily and complaining.�They are obviously different types of people and different characters,� said Wales manager Chris Coleman.�Whatever Bale brings to the table for us, that's him. He's not manufactured. He doesn't try to be something he's not.�Gareth is clearly a special player.

But Amir struck with his 14th ball back in first-class cricket on English soil.Left-hander Trescothick, on eight, could only edge a superb outswinger that moved late and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed held an excellent diving catch.Amir had another wicket when a full-length inswinger bowled first-class debutant Adam Hose (10).And eight minutes after lunch, Amir bowled Peter Trego (23) with another fine inswinger that knocked over the batsman�s middle stump and left the other two standing.""He bowled very well,"" said the 40-year-old Trescothick, whose nine-balls faced on Monday were all bowled by Amir, after stumps.""He swung the ball really late, that�s the biggest thing we noticed.<br/>""In my �magnificent� eight I thought it was pretty hard work, it was tricky,"" added Trescothick, who in 76 Tests from 2000-2006 scored 5,825 runs at an average of nearly 44 with 14 hundreds./><strong>�Guessing�</strong""You get a lot of bowlers who swing it quite early but he (Amir) was swinging it late and as it was coming down the pitch you were almost guessing whether it was an inswinger or whether it was one of the straight ones,"" the Somerset stalwart explained.Trescothick was in no doubt that, on this form, Amir could threaten England�s current top order.""On that performance yes he will cause problems for England. ""He got Adam Hose with a good inswinger round the wicket and Pete Trego got an absolute beauty.""That bit of extra pace is the thing. He hasn�t played international cricket for a number of years so there�s probably an extra bit of zip that he has that makes him hard work.""Despite suggestions from England captain Alastair Cook that spectators might jeer Amir, there was nothing but polite applause as he came on to bowl in Taunton.""I don�t think you�d expect anything else,"" said Trescothick. ""We get on and play the game and it is what it is.""Meanwhile Pakistan opener Shan Masood said of Amir: ""He hasn�t lost it. If anything, he�s just got better.""England swept aside Sri Lanka 2-0 in a three-match Test series and have an impressive home record.""We have to respect England, how good they are ... but we�re up for it,"" insisted Masood.""We�re ready to come to England and give them a good match.""",7/5/2016,,

Italy are a team with automated plays. They are world class in playing them but they are predictable,"" Loew told reporters.""France are different. They constantly change positions, they are much more unexpected and difficult to predict.""Loew is likely to use Emre Can as Khedira's replacement with Benedikt Hoewedes slipping into the central defence for Hummels.The French are feeling confident following their 5-2 demolition of Iceland and the euphoria in the country is growing. But, in order to reach a home final in Paris on July 10, Didier Deschamp's team must plug their porous defence.Leading 4-0 at halftime against Iceland, France dropped their guard, conceding two goals. Centre back Samuel Umtiti, playing his first international, was not totally commanding and Adil Rami, who was suspended, could return for the German game.Rami, however, has shown signs of nerves on several occasions, as has left back Patrice Evra, leaving France's defence looking vulnerable, notably from set pieces.""We're looking better but Germany remains Germany,"" said Deschamps, whose side lost to the eventual winners in the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals as well as suffering painful semi-final defeats to the Germans at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups.""They are the best team in Europe and in the world and the only ones totally controlling the situation, with technical quality everywhere, from the goalkeeper to the forwards,"" said the coach.""We'll fight for our chances, knowing what we are up against.""",7/6/2016,,

But after the trauma of clashes between Russian and England fans earlier in the tournament, German and French fans packed bars and cafes in a calm atmosphere.Many cars in Marseille were decked out in French tricolour flags with children, their faces painted, wearing France caps.""Day of glory,"" trumpeted the front page of L�Equipe newspaper over a picture of the French team congratulating star midfielder Paul Pogba on scoring a goal.Neither country has announced a team for the match, which starts at 1900 GMT, but Germany�s Joachim Loew said that captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fit to start after an injury scare in the penalty shootout win over Italy.""In a game like this, his experience is very valuable and, in any case, he will start,"" Loew said Wednesday.strong>- Misers and hot shots -</strongThe European Championship hosts will be looking to beat Germany, the World Cup holders, in a major tournament for the first time in 58 years.Germany have triumphed in three World Cup encounters since then, the last in the 2014 quarter-finals. Their most famous meeting was the 1982 semi-final when France�s Patrick Battiston had to be revived by medics on the pitch after a brutal clash with German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher.Bayern Munich�s Manuel Neuer, the most miserly goalkeeper in the tournament, and Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann as leading scorer could hold the key to their latest encounter however.Griezmann scored two of his four goals in France�s impressive 5-2 quarter-final win over Iceland.Neuer has conceded only one goal in regulation time in five games -- a spot-kick against Italy in the quarter-finals, a tie Germany won on penalties.""We need to score goals. This is a team that doesn�t concede a lot of goals,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Everyone talks about their attack, but they know how to defend,"" he added.Loew is aware of the French threat.""We are going to have to be compact and close down the space in defence,"" he said.""France are going to be the toughest opponents we have had in the tournament until now.""Deschamps has no injury problems and welcomes back midfielder N�Golo Kante and defender Adil Rami to contend for places after both served suspensions against Iceland.With many French fans looking back to the 1982 battle, Deschamps said: ""We can�t change past history, but we�ve got our own page to write.""Apart from the return of Schweinsteiger, Loew gave no other team details and he faces tough choices.Centre-back Mats Hummels picked up a yellow card and is suspended. Striker Mario Gomez and midfielder Sami Khedira picked up injuries which ruled them out and made Schweinsteiger�s presence even more essential.Bayern man Thomas Mueller, normally a regular source of goals for Germany, has yet to score at the tournament.But Mueller said reaching the final and getting a chance to add the Euro trophy to the World Cup title won in 2014 is all that matters.""Reaching that goal is what drives me on.

sports,Somerset Coach sees Andy Roberts Mohammad Amir,"strong>TAUNTON, United Kingdom: As a left-arm fast bowler, Mohammad Amir is often compared to Pakistan predecessor Wasim Akram.</strongBut having seen Amir close up during Pakistan�s opening match of their England tour, Somerset coach Matthew Maynard was struck by a likeness to a fast bowler from an earlier generation than Akram in 1970s West Indies great Andy Roberts.As well as sheer speed, right-armer Roberts was known for his ability to bowl a second bouncer that was markedly quicker than the first one a batsman had received from the Antiguan.They may have very different delivery actions, but having witnessed Amir mark his return to first-class cricket in England with three for 36 in Somerset�s first innings, Maynard was clear the 24-year-old had something of Roberts�s bowling intelligence about him.And this despite Amir having only recently returned from a five-year ban and jail sentence imposed for his part in bowling deliberate no balls as part of a tabloid newspaper sting during the 2010 Test between England and Pakistan at Lord�s.""He was swinging it massive in the first innings, proper late big swing,"" said former England batsman Maynard of Amir.""He�s a threat, he always has been, hasn�t he? He�s got that pace, he�s wiry, he�s got a change-up, you don�t see that too often these days,"" he added.""He�s someone who almost bowls at 90 percent, 95 percent of his capabilities and then he throws that 100 percenter in, that change of pace up, like the old great Andy Roberts,"" explained the 50-year-old Maynard.""We don�t see that as often these days,"" said Maynard, with Amir in line to make his Test return at, of all places, Lord�s where a four-match series with England starts on July 14.The Somerset coach also had words of praise for Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah, returning to first-class cricket after several months out serving a drugs ban for taking a masking agent.Shah almost bowled Pakistan to victory at Taunton by taking four for 107 in 32 overs as Somerset clung on for a draw on Tuesday�s final day of three.""Yasir Shah, first outing what for six months or so in this game? He hardly bowled a bad ball, he was getting his fingers round it as the spell developed on a wicket that was pretty unresponsive for him, he looks a class act,"" said Maynard.strong>- �Quality line-up� -</strongPakistan boast a powerful middle order featuring captain Misbah-ul-Haq and fellow veteran stroke-maker Younis Khan.Maynard said that if Pakistan�s openers -- who were Mohammad Hafeez and Shan Masood at Somerset -- could get through the opening overs from England�s James Anderson and Stuart Broad, the team could yet spring a surprise.""Their openers potentially, if they sort that out, if they can get off to good starts, I�m sure they will get enough runs on the board.""We know that Pakistan have always had a quality bowling line-up. They learn to bowl on good true wickets and the skills that they develop are terrific.""I think England are in a brilliant place as a team at the moment. They are playing good, positive cricket, aggressive with the bat and likewise aggressive and disciplined with the ball. I think it will be a great series.""Somerset stalwart Marcus Trescothick may have been out for eight in the first innings, but the 40-year-old former England opener, who could easily have chosen to miss this match, made 106 in the southwest county�s second innings.""At the end of the day, when you get a senior player like Marcus who does what he does, not only with the bat but with the intensity he runs between the wickets, he loves the game and that rubs off, that�s such a powerful tool,"" said Maynard.""Whatever we say as coaches pales into insignificance when you�ve got a peer who goes about his business like Marcus...

So for me it was about staying in the match and somehow hope for his level to drop ... and maybe get a bit lucky. That's exactly what happened at 3-3, 0-40 (in the third set),"" added Federer about the game where he saved three break points.""Obviously the breaker was crazy. It was an incredible match.

sports,Griezmann and Ronaldo clash in final for second time in six ,"strong>MARSEILLE:</strong> When France meet Portugal in Sunday's Euro 2016 final, the outcome is likely to depend on the performances of Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann -- the second time the two players have clashed with a European trophy at stake in six weeks.Portugal's Ronaldo steered Real Madrid to their Champions League triumph at the end of May after his French rival Griezmann missed a penalty for city rivals Atletico.The France striker has certainly bounced back from that disappointment. He is the competition's top scorer with six goals, having scored both goals in Thursday's defeat of world champions Germany.Portugal's master tactician Fernando Santos needs to cut supply lines to a player whom the French call ""Monsieur Griezmann"" as a sign of respect -- despite his boyish looks.It will be a challenge.While Portugal saw off Wales, the Welsh playmaker Gareth Bale was still given enough space to create chances and were outdone more by the absence of midfield creativity than by Portuguese prowess.That will not be the case for France who have a larger arsenal. Even if Portugal can snuff out Griezmann, Dmitiri Payet, the stand-out performer in the earlier rounds, can change a game in seconds.Front man Olivier Giroud has also proved a handful by weighing on defences and making space for those around him.strong>TEAM SPIRIT</strongWhat has worked for Portugal has been an incredible team spirit with a mantra that they are not playing to look pretty, but to win, irrespective of style.Santos has fashioned a well-drilled 4-4-2 and kept to it throughout despite injuries. The loss of Pepe at the back was hardly noticeable against Wales with Bruno Alves stepping in admirably.From France's match with Germany, Santos will have noted that Didier Deschamps' team has a weakness on its flanks, in particular on the left with Patrice Evra.The Germans pushed the French very deep by using their full backs almost as wingers. For much of the match, France's midfield duo of Paul Pogba and Blaise Matudi chased shadows, leaving Joshua Kimmich and Jonas Hector with acres of space.Portugal's full backs Raphael Guerreiro and Cedric Soares are good enough to replicate that, which could push Deschamps to move away from the more attacking 4-2-3-1 formation to revert to a 4-3-3, restoring defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante.But whether the Portuguese midfield has the capacity of a Bastian Schweinsteiger or Toni Kroos to stifle France is questionable.strong>NO DEPENDENCY ON RONALDO</strongDanilo, who replaced William Carvalho against Wales, was strong and efficient in the holding midfield role, but has limits going forward.Joao Mario and Adrien Silva do not appear to have the killer pass for Ronaldo or strike partner Nani. That may open the door for playmaker Joao Moutinho to return.What has been evident with this Portugal side is that they are no longer a side entirely dependent on Ronaldo. On the contrary, when he goes missing, others shine.In the quarter-final against Poland, 18-year-old Renato Sanches took the plaudits, while Nani has netted three times.Portugal's most high-profile player may have three goals, but his Real Madrid explosiveness has been absent. He has had to fit into Santos' team ethos, playing a less glamorous role. Captain Ronaldo tracks back and encourages his teammates.Arguably by being quiet he may prove more lethal. France's defenders can not fall into the sleepy rhythm Portugal have set during the tournament because Ronaldo has enough to turn the tide as his majestic header against Wales showed.",7/8/2016,,

sports,Beaumont and Winfield secure clean ,"CHELMSFORD: A fifth won toss in six and Heather Knight had no qualms batting first: England had won all 11 previous matches at Chelmsford and, with that in mind, Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield ensured a 12th was sewn up early with an opening stand of 108.�Across the six matches, the first England wicket has been worth 801 - more than half of their team's runs. When Pakistan do return to their own beds, a few of their bowlers might want to check under them to ensure Beaumont and Winfield are nowhere to be seen. Both their half-centuries were typical of their play over the last month: Winfield willing and on the front foot, Beaumont wristy and devastating.�The familiarity spread right through�to the game's conclusion. Pakistan were run ragged in the field and, facing a total they had no intention of chasing -�Danni Wyatt pilfered 11 from the first four balls of the final over to help England set 170 -�it was just a matter or whether they would be bowled out in the allotted time. In the end, they finished seven wickets down and 57 short.��England rang changes with the ball, the most noticeable being left-armer Tash Farrant coming in for Katherine Brunt. Having made her debut at the age of 17, Farrant spent two years on the sidelines from January 2014 to February 2016, when Mark Robinson gave her a run out in England's final T20I before the World T20.�Hers is an example he was keen to address: a player picked young yet too young to cope with being dropped and overlooked for a prolonged�period. Now 20, she looked�at ease, cycling through her variations and even nabbing the wicket of opener Nahida Khan with a slower ball that was�flat-batted back to her. There were first international wickets, too, for Alex Hartley.��Talking about how easy you find things is one of cricket's great taboos, but even Heather Knight, a measured individual who seems to cringe at her own success, might wonder what all the fuss of captaining your country is about.��From the early part of Robinson's tenure as head coach, it was evident that both he and Knight were on the same page. In one of their first coach-player interactions, Knight said she wanted to move away from feeling like�the onus is on her to bat for as long as possible. She wanted freedom.�As captain, she has been able to afford that to the rest of her team. All this while questions were being�asked of whether life after Charlotte Edwards would really be so rosy.�Those answers will not be able to be given just yet, but Knight was understandably punchy in the press conference.��""There was a lot of noise around the squad before the series and the girls have responded. The cricket we have played has been really entertaining to watch. Everyone is feeding off the success of each other and it's been a really nice place to be.""�That last point is key. Perhaps one of the most noticeable elements of this England side is how much more open they seem. And while players young and experienced have commented on how Robinson has created a relaxed atmosphere, it has been particularly clear�to former players no longer in the system.��Caroline Atkins, who represented England between 2001 and 2011, was taken aback at how at ease the players were when she was around the team at Taunton as they prepared for the third ODI. It was not an atmosphere she was used to. Isa Guha and Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent have also presented caps to debutants during this tour, something that has rarely happened in English women's cricket. Rainford-Brent, who� presented Hartley with her T20 cap before this match, was even invited into the team huddle -�a ringed haven usually reserved for squad members.���There are of course elements that still need work. On a personnel level, Kate Cross' return to international cricket, after an impressive pre-season tour of Sri Lanka with the England Academy, was disappointing, as she took�1 for 56 from the 11 overs she bowled across the first two ODIs. Cross will spend the next few weeks up to the�inaugural Women's Super League fine-tuning some technical aspects of her game, such as her front arm, before leading the Lancashire Tunder in what is hoped to be a testing�fortnight of high-level�cricket. She will hope her name will be added to the long list of seamers Robinson has healed.��Long term, it will be interesting to see whether the confidence gained from these six matches can carry through into something more sustainable. This is not a team that likes to blow their own trumpet. But after six matches of runs, wickets and outright dominance, and given the manner in which they are looking to play their cricket, they might have to get used to it.",7/8/2016,,

sports,Sussex give tough time to Pakistani,"HOVE: Sussex's openers, Luke Wells and Harry Finch, added 212 for the first wicket before they declared 72 runs behind, offering Pakistanis the chance to see how keen they are for a proper game on the final day.The ball did not swing conventionally before lunch and the lines were not consistent which enabled Finch and Wells to make a flyer: the fifty up in the eighth over, 120 in 27 by lunch.In the first session it was a case of who bowled least worse but in the hour before tea Wahab Riaz provided a reminder of the danger that can be posed almost out of nowhere when the older ball starts to move.Wells was the first to fall when Wahab, who overstepped 10 times striving for pace, returned for his second spell of the day, his first from the Cromwell Road End, and started to find reverse swing with impressive pace: he will never be a bowler picked for economy, but he has the ability to rattle the batsmen. Wells drove flat-footed at a full delivery, edging behind seven short of a century, then Matt Machan was almost yorked first ball before being beaten by his second delivery.Finch, opening the batting for the first time in first-class cricket, reached his century in Wahab's next over, when he square-drove his 16th boundary, but two balls later was tempted into driving a full delivery and edged to slip.At the Sea End, Imran Khan picked up a brace himself, although they owed a little more to the batsmen's errors. Machan was lbw after a horrid swipe across the line then Ben Brown drove loosely at his first ball: 212 without loss had become 233 for 4 in the blink of an eye.Wells' innings was a continuation of a strong run of form for the tall left-hander who had made 181 last week against Glamorgan. His fifty off 54 balls included 10 boundaries and seven more followed before Wahab found his edge.Finch, whose previous first-class hundred had come against Leeds/Bradford MCCU at the start of this season, gave one chance on 64 when he drove low to short cover off Zulfiqar Babar, but he was particularly impressive on the front foot. His century also included three sixes.Having come in to face a hat-trick ball on first-class debut, Philip Salt played positively after tea before Craig Cachopa was given lbw on the front foot to Zulfiqar to bring the declaration with 24 overs left in the day.For the fourth time on the tour, Mohammad Hafeez reached double figures but not much further when, on 23, he pulled Jofra Archer to deep square leg. As a senior batsman, Pakistan will need Hafeez to lift his game in the Tests to ensure Azhar Ali and Younis Khan are not constantly exposed to the new ball.Shan Masood reached the close unbeaten on 38 but was never entirely convincing. Having given the same top seven both these warm-up matches, Pakistan have set their stall out for the opening Test but, as far as the first-wicket pair are concerned, they will enter more in hope than expectation.�",7/10/2016,,

All I do is think of how my players will play and I want them to play their best in order to win.""A tearful Ronaldo and his distraught team-mates were stunned by their failure in that final and must have wondered if they would ever get so close to major tournament glory again.Now they are 90 minutes away from the title and after the semi-final win against Wales Ronaldo said: ""I hope on Sunday you�ll see me crying with joy.""",7/10/2016,,

Speaking about England�s leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson out of the test due to injury, he said it does not matter who England plays or not, the only thing which matters in this series is that we have to play at our best.�English team is very good at the moment as they thumped Sri Lanka in the series,� he said while talking to a private news channel.He said our openers are struggling at the moment and we have to pay special attention to it. �Though Muhammad Hafeez is looking lost in the English conditions but still we should open with him,� he said.He said Hafeez has struggled outside Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). �England and Australia series are very important for Hafeez�s career.��He should know that he is not a youngster anymore and if he doesn�t perform then he won�t get many chances,� he said. Waqar said if Hafeez doesn�t go well as an opener in this series then we should try Sami Aslam.�He said Pakistan will be facing many challenges in this series when it comes to British media, the pitches and the conditions there. �Fingers will also be raised on Mohammad Amir but our focus should be on winning the series,� he said.He said our cricketers got plentiful of time prior to the series to practice well. �Now if they (players) fail they cannot complain that they did not get enough time to prepare themselves for the series,� he said.Waqar said Amir is a very good bowler and can do well in any pitch. �Wahab Raiz, Imran Khan, Sohail Khan and Rahat Ali are good bowlers and can do well in the series depends on the conditions of pitches they are played on,� he said.It may be mentioned that Waqar faced great criticism after Pakistan was unable to make it to the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 2016. After winning against Bangladesh in the World T20, the team lost against New Zealand, India and Australia, leading to their outing.On April 4, Waqar resigned as head coach of the team, just after Shahid Afridi resigned as T20 captain.",7/11/2016,,

sports,Amir s career set to come full cir,"strong>LONDON: The floppy hair he had as a teenager may have been replaced by a shorter cut and the once clean-shaven face is now home to a goatee beard.</strongBut there was no mistaking the whippy left-arm action as Mohammad Amir ran into bowl against Somerset at Taunton last week or the ""airplane"" celebration that greeted his three first-innings wickets.It was a sight many fans would have been forgiven for thinking they would ever see again on an English field after Amir�s career came to a dramatic and possibly terminal halt at Lord�s in 2010.During that year�s Test against England, Amir and Pakistan new-ball partner Mohammad Asif bowled no-balls to order on the instructions of their captain Salman Butt as part of a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.All three received five-year bans from cricket and, together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.<br/>There was a sense of shock and anger among cricket fans, although in Amir�s case there was also an overwhelming sense of sadness that an 18-year-old should have become caught up in such a scandal.Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding is not given to excessive displays of emotion in his work as a television commentator and pundit.Yet he was in tears as he discussed Amir�s plight live on air the morning after the night the story broke during the Lord�s Test.For Amir was -- and on the evidence of the Somerset match still is -- a superbly skilled bowler, with the rare ability to make the ball swing late at sharp pace off a good length, one of the most difficult types of bowling for even the best batsmen to face.It helped him earn him the Pakistan man of the series award against England after he had taken 19 wickets at under 19 apiece in four Tests.Amir, Asif and Butt were all given five-year bans by the International Cricket Council and the trio were all jailed by an English court.Yet the talent Amir had shown created a certain sympathy among cricket fans amid a widespread belief that he had been led astray by more experienced team-mates./><strong>'Second chance�</strongNevertheless there were plenty of calls at the time and since for the three players to all be given life bans.<br/>Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking soon after the scandal broke, saw both points of view.""Part of me says you�ve got to make a statement, and say: �Right, ban for life�....But another part of me says, �Should you give a person another chance?�.""Amir who served three months in an English young offenders� institute, now has that chance.He has only played limited overs internationals for Pakistan since his return, but his career could come full circle when the first of a four-Test series against England starts at Lord�s on Thursday.Interestingly, Amir himself is now in favour of life bans, telling AFP in an interview in Karachi last month: ""If fixing is still happening then it�s really alarming. I fully back that fixers should be banned for life.""With Amir�s talent undimmed, Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was in no doubt of his potential.<br/>""If you look at his bowling speed, swing and control -- it�s there,"" said Misbah ahead of the Somerset match.<br/>""He can still be the best bowler in the world.""England captain Alastair Cook, who played in the 2010 match, suggested Amir might get a rough ride from the Lord�s crowd.But there were no boos at Taunton and he could well get a polite reception at the ""home of cricket"".<br/>""You don�t see many 18-year-old�s bowl like he did, he is an exceptional talent,"" said Cook at Lord�s last week.<br/>""It will be difficult for us.""Meanwhile Amir is well aware of his good fortune. ""I still can�t believe that this is happening,"" he said.<br/>""You call it a coincidence or whatever but for me it�s a blessing that I am restarting (Tests) right at Lord�s from where I stopped in 2010.""",7/11/2016,,

There are no words to describe this feeling.""/><strong>�Ugly duckling�</strong""Football is cruel, but it�s also magnificent.

""He gave me strength and positive energy.""/><strong>Ronaldo applauded</strongThe sultry night began with a swarm of moths flitting around the French national stadium and littering the playing surface.There was an early exchange of chances -- Nani shooting over for Portugal, Griezmann�s header drawing a fine finger-tip save from Rui Patricio -- before Ronaldo took centre-stage.A juddering knee-on-knee challenge by Payet in the eighth minute left Ronaldo writhing on the turf and after attempting to play on, he dropped to the ground, tears filling his eyes.After having his left knee heavily strapped, Ronaldo re-entered the fray, only to go down again, flinging his armband to the floor.A stretcher was brought on and as the Portugal captain was carried off, to be replaced by Ricardo Quaresma, the whole stadium rose to applaud.France�s Moussa Sissoko stepped into the spotlight vacated by Ronaldo, driving a left-foot shot over the bar and then stinging Rui Patricio�s palms after nutmegging Adrien Silva with a slick Cruyff turn.But it took the 58th-minute introduction of Kingsley Coman to enliven France. The Bayern Munich winger crossed for Griezmann to head over and released Olivier Giroud for a shot that Rui Patricio parried.Rui Patricio also repelled a 25-yard effort from Sissoko and when France substitute Andre-Pierre Gignac neatly sidestepped the fit-again Pepe in stoppage time, he could only scuff his shot against the post.",7/11/2016,,

sports,Misbah set to finally realise Lords dr,"LONDON: Mohammad Amir may be the centre of attention in the build-up to the first Test against England at Lord�s, but Thursday�s match is also a milestone for Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq.Selection rows and fall-outs with previous Pakistan regimes mean that experienced batsman Misbah is now making his first Test tour of England at the advanced age of 42.It was six years ago that Amir, new-ball partner Mohammad Asif and then-captain Salman Butt tarnished the reputation of Pakistan cricket with their involvement in a spot-fixing affair that saw the trio conspire to deliberately bowl no-balls during the 2010 Lord�s Test against England.All three were given five-year bans and jail sentences.The intervening period has not been easy for Pakistan, who have had to get used to playing all their ""home"" matches in the United Arab Emirates because of security concerns arising from an armed attack on Sri Lanka�s team coach in Lahore in 2009.But under Misbah�s shrewed guidance Pakistan have become tough to beat in the UAE and a competitive side abroad, traits reflected in their third place in the current world Test rankings -- one position above England.Indeed they have yet to lose a Test series in their adopted home, with England beaten in two of those campaigns for an aggregate 5-0 scoreline in Pakistan�s favour.An experienced batsman who has had a calming effect on the players around him, Misbah has overseen the reintegration of Amir into the side.Having coped with the understandable interest in Amir making his return to Test cricket at Lord�s, the scene of the crime, Misbah had no problems in fending off enquiries about how long he intends to keep playing for Pakistan.""My retirement has been discussed every series,"" Misbah told reporters at Lord�s on Wednesday. ""I could have retired after the UAE against England (last year) -- but we�ve been playing together for six years.""I decided I need to be here in a tough series for Pakistan, and I really want to do well here.""Misbah has a fine Test record, with nearly 4,500 runs at an impressive average of nearly 49 in 61 matches.Yet for all his experience, there is still something special about playing a Test at ""the home of cricket"".""There are no nerves (yet),"" said Misbah. ""That�s something you always wait for.""It�s a big occasion -- everyone wants to play at Lord�s, just to perform well here and get the respect of every spectator and supporter.""But for Misbah it is the health of the Pakistan team, rather than personal goals, which remains his priority.""If you analyse what we did in the last six years, it�s overall discipline, belief -- consistently playing the same team,"" he said. ""We missed bowlers -- but Yasir Shah came in, and they�ve been outstanding.""With the batting line-up, it�s discipline"".He added: ""Luckily, we played most cricket in UAE, have got used to conditions and made the most of it.""It�s given us good confidence, and that is really helping in Test cricket.""�",7/13/2016,,

Amir made his domestic comeback playing for Omar Associates in the Grade II Patron�s Trophy on March 13, 2015. He took a wicket in his first comeback over.On August 19, 2015, Amir was declared completely free to play all forms of cricket from September 2, 2015.He made his return to international cricket on January 15 this year, in a Twenty20 match against New Zealand. In February 2016, Amir took a hat-trick in a Pakistan Super League match for Karachi Kings.As Amir is all set to make a return to Test cricket on the same venue after a gap of six years, many cricketers believe that the pacer would make a strong impact in the game.Former Twenty skipper Shahid Afridi said the media was �putting undue pressure� on Amir. He urged Amir to stay strong in the series in England.�I am hopeful that Amir will fulfill the expectations of everyone and will perform with all his might in the series against England,� he said while talking to a news channel.Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq said if you look at Amir�s bowling speed, swing and control it is there. �I think he can still be the best bowler in the world,� he said.�He knows he is under pressure but he is handling that very well. It is a good opportunity for him to come here, where he had those problems, and show the world he can perform and deliver for the team and win back all his fans. That�s what he is working hard for,� he said.Former pacer Shoaib Akhtar had advised Amir to remain humble on the England tour and perform with all his might on the field.�The best way for Amir to counter is to perform on the field which I am sure he can do. But he also has to remain humble and not show attitude. He has to blend in with his teammates and win matches for them,� he said.Pacer Wahab Riaz said as a team, as a squad of 17 plus our team management, all of us are going to support Amir. �We are all behind him, we are all supporting him, whenever he needs us, however he needs us, we will be around him all the time,� he said.",7/13/2016,,

He said that the bowler was mentally very strong and expressed the hope that Amir would fulfill the expectations that everyone had from him.�In response to a question about Mohommad Amir playing for the first time after his spot-fixing scandal, Afridi stated that it was an old practice of the British media to pressurize any cricketer they viewed as a threat before an important series.�On the issue of retirement, Afridi said he had never been a burden on the national cricket team. The all-rounder said that God had bestowed him with a lot of respect and that he would continue to play cricket with respect and also quit the game with dignity.�In response to a question about improving cricket for women in the country, Afridi stated that it was important first to enhance men's cricket in the country.

sports,Tendulkar calls for more help from pitches for bowler,"strong>MUMBAI: Cricket pitches need to be more bowler-friendly if the rising imbalance between bat and ball is to be addressed, Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar has said.</strongThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) world cricket committee on Tuesday recommended limitations on the thickness and depth of bats amid concerns that the sport has tilted heavily in favour of the batsmen in recent years.A report commissioned by the MCC, the guardian of the game's laws, in 2014 found the thickness of bats had marginally increased in the last century and that edges had broadened by 300 percent, meaning even mistimed shots could still find the boundary.Tendulkar, who quit international cricket in 2013 as the game's most prolific batsman both in tests and the 50-over format, demanded more assistance for the bowlers from the playing surface.""The wickets need to change; they need to be more helpful for bowlers,"" Tendulkar said.""In T20s, the greatest of bowlers are being reverse-swept. Three-hundred is no longer competitive in ODIs.""So there should be at least one format where bowlers have a better chance of executing their skills and making it more interesting for spectators.""I don't think it's got much to do with bats, but I'm sure people on the (relevant) panel will be able to look into it.""Tendulkar's views echoed the sentiments of Australian opener David Warner who said last week that flat pitches rather than bats with thicker edges are the reason batsmen have the upper hand in test cricket.Tendulkar was part of the panel that recommended Anil Kumble for the India coach's job and he expects the team to benefit from the vast experience of the former leg-spinner.""A fabulous player, a hard competitor and will not make any compromises on the field,"" Tendulkar told ESPNcricinfo.""He will be out there to win each and every moment.""He played for almost 20 years, so there is plenty to share. I'll just tell the players to grasp as much information from Anil as possible.""Kumble, who came out to bowl with a bandaged jaw in a 2002 Antigua test, can also teach the players how to handle adversity, said Tendulkar.""There are always big, crunch moments in any match and how to approach those moments is important,"" Tendulkar said.""In sport, over a period of time what you learn is not every day you are successful, sometimes you have to face failures.""It is all about being a tough character and be able to stand back on your feet again and to compete the next day.

We felt empty when we took the wickets to win the match and did not celebrate,"" he added.""The relationship between the two teams was fractured because we all knew the damage it would do to cricket.""Pietersen, who last played for England in 2014, said there was no excuse for cricketers.""In cricket the education players receive is so thorough.

But Shah turned the tide when he had Root carelessly hole out off a miscued sweep on 48.James Vince and the recalled Gary Ballance were both lbw as they each failed to �pick� Shah.Cook�s cut four off Amir took him to 61 and beyond Gavaskar�s mark of 9,607 runs as a Test opener.Amir eventually drew Cook wide and got the left-hander to play on to end a 124-ball innings featuring 12 fours.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a top-order slump in recent times.<br/> But on Friday he was deceived into playing back to Shah and bowled by a top-spinner for 29.That left England 193 for six and they were 232 for seven when, after a prolonged review, Yasir won a tight �umpire�s call� decision to have Moeen Ali lbw on the sweep for 23.Even before Ali�s exit had finally been confirmed, Shah had saluted his fifth wicket Friday by kissing the turf. It was the fifth time in just 13 Tests that the 30-year-old Shah had taken five or more wickets in an innings.Earlier, Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.Misbah only added four to his overnight 110 not out before he was bowled by Stuart Broad.Amir, booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four and was hit on the helmet next delivery when he ducked into another Broad ball. He was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.",7/15/2016,,
sports,Amir snares Cook for first wicket of Test retur,"LONDON: Pakistan�s Mohammad Amir took his first Test wicket in six years when be bowled England captain Alastair Cook at Lord�s on Friday.Amir was making his return to Test cricket at the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls as part of a newspaper �sting� during that year�s Lord�s Test against England.The 24-year-old paceman suffered the frustration Friday of seeing fellow left-hander Cook dropped off his bowling by slip Mohammad Hafeez and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed, who both missed routine chances, when the opener was on 22 and 55 respectively.But with Cook in sight of a hundred on the second day of the first of a four-Test series, Amir took the fielders out of the equation by inducing Cook to play on for 81.That left England 171 for five in reply to Pakistan�s first innings 339 -- a deficit of 168 runs.At that stage, Amir had taken one for 46 in 12.2 overs, with his 52nd Test wicket coming in his 15th match at this level.Cook, always a prize wicket for any opposition bowler, had suggested before this match that if it were down to him, all fixers, including Amir, would be banned for life.However, the England skipper added that as Amir had ""served his time"" he had ""no problems"" in playing against him in this four-match series.By dismissing Cook, Amir had taken his first wicket in a Test match since he dismissed England�s Graeme Swann on his way to figures of six for 84 in an innings and 225-run defeat for Pakistan at Lord�s in 2010 -- a result overshadowed by the spot-fixing scandal.Amir struggled for line and length early in his spell Friday but became increasingly effective as the sunny skies above Lord�s gave way to swing-friendly grey clouds.Cook, on 22, was drawn forward by an excellent delivery only for first slip Hafeez to drop the straightforward catch.It was a similar story when Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but Sarfraz Ahmed, going slightly to his left, floored the two-handed chance.<br/> Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the bowler a consoling pat on the back.The floppy hair Amir sported as a teenage may have given away to a shorter cut and his once clean shaven face may now be home to a goatee beard, but when Cook was out there was no mistaking Amir�s trademark arms outstretched �airplane� celebration.Earlier on Friday, tailender Amir was booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat.He inside edged his first ball, from Stuart Broad, for four. Next ball he was hit on the helmet as he ducked into a Broad delivery. But Amir also hit two well-struck boundaries before he was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.�",7/15/2016,,
sports,Cook dropped twice as England reach 153 4 at ,"After being rattled out inside the first hour at Lord's, Pakistan needed to take their chances with the ball in order for their first-innings 339 to assume more daunting proportions. They proceeded to drop Alastair Cook twice, with his unbeaten 75 anchoring the England reply, but three wickets during the afternoon session for Yasir Shah kept Pakistan in the hunt.Chris Woakes' maiden five-wicket haul in Tests had helped finish off Pakistan with only 57 added to their overnight score before the stage was transported back to 2010, as Mohammad Amir prepared to bowl to Cook once again. Amir had previously removed Cook three times in five Tests and he should have added to that tally here but for glaring errors by Mohammad Hafeez, at first slip, and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Cook put on 110 with Joe Root for the second wicket but Yasir struck for his first Test wickets outside of Asia to check England's advance. Root, in his first innings replacing Nick Compton at No. 3, looked at something like his dynamic best before trying slightly too hard to force the pace and top-edging a slog-sweep off Yasir straight up in the air to be taken at midwicket.That gave Pakistan a look at England's reshaped middle-order, with James Vince moving up to No. 4 above the recalled Gary Ballance. Vince briefly shimmered on an otherwise dull, cloudy afternoon, before playing back to be lbw to Yasir - DRS confirming it would have clipped leg stump - for a fifth innings without a significant score at Test level. Ballance clipped one four but was then beaten by a gently turning legbreak, pushing down the wrong line, to leave England 153 for 4 at tea.Amir's first delivery in Test cricket after a five-year ban for his involvement in spot-fixing on this ground was met by a few pseudo-witty cries of ""no-ball"" from the crowd and it was unceremoniously tucked away into the covers for a single by Cook. Amir struggled with his line and length, leaking 33 runs from six overs before lunch, but ought to have removed the England captain when he had made 22, slanting the ball in to take the edge just as he did as a teenager, only for Hafeez to make a mess of a straightforward low catch.Rahat Ali was more accurate with the new ball and he picked up Alex Hales in his first over, angling a delivery across to have him taken at third slip. Cook took advantage of too many deliveries on his pads to pick up seven boundaries - including another edge through the cordon off Amir - and score at more than a run a ball, as he and Root ticked up a fifty stand before lunch.There was further anguish for Amir when he began his second spell during the afternoon, his first delivery luring Cook into a drive as the ball left him, only for the ball to hit Sarfraz on the wrist as he dived to his left.In the morning session, a burst of three wickets in eight balls, including the dismissal of Misbah-ul-Haq for 114, had helped England wrap up Pakistan's innings. Woakes collected two of them to finish with 6 for 70 and join Misbah in having his name added to the honours board. Having been 282 for 4 shortly before the close on Thursday, Pakistan would have been disappointed to make only 339.Misbah, fresh from becoming the oldest captain to score a Test hundred, began the second day with designs on seeing his side up towards 400 and a secure position from which his bowlers could mount an attack. He could only add four runs to his overnight score, however, before Stuart Broad brought a delivery back to burst between bat and pad and rattle the stumps.That dismissal meant Pakistan had gone from 310 for 7 to 316 for 9, with Woakes removing Ahmed and Wahab Riaz in the preceding over. Sarfraz had looked in dangerous mood, frequently stepping down the pitch to cut and drive on his way to 25 from 29 deliveries but he gifted his wicket when slapping a short, wide delivery to backward point to give Woakes his maiden five-for.Two deliveries later, Wahab was following Sarfraz back to the pavilion, as Woakes followed up an excellent outswinger with one of the fastest balls of the match, full and ducking in past a flimsy defence to remove off stump from the ground.As the crowd applauded Woakes' achievements, Amir walked out for his first involvement in a Test since the corresponding Lord's Test in 2010. This was not the main event, of course, but he helped add 23 runs for the final wicket with Yasir Shah in an eventful cameo: his first ball was inside-edged for four over his stumps, the second, also from Broad, went flying off the back of his helmet. There were a couple more genuine boundary strokes before Amir steered Broad to second slip to complete a good morning's work for England.",7/15/2016,,

It looked as if Misbah was about to celebrate his achievement by prostrating himself on the turf in prayer.But instead he performed a series of press-ups in what appeared to be a joke aimed at critics who questioned whether he is now too old for international cricket.The gesture also a wry reference to the pre-tour �army-style� training camp the squad were put through at the Pakistan Military Academy in the northwestern town of Kakul.""A lot of things have been said about my technique and the outside edge, and the� celebration...

But on Saturday he fell for nought when he lofted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck but one of those records was now under threat.The unsettled Younis Khan played on to Ali for 25 two balls after driving him for four. Asad Shafiq struck a well-made 49 before,in sight of his second fifty of the match, he was bowled by a Woakes �trimmer�.Earlier, Shah produced the best innings bowling by a visiting spinner against England in a Test at Lord�s since Sid Pegler�s seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.Both sides knew that Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing fourth-day surface on Sunday.England resumed on their overnight 253 for seven, after Shah induced a middle-order collapse on Friday.They added just 19 more runs Saturday, with Woakes on 35 not out as he emphasised his all-round credentials.�",7/16/2016,,

But a review showed the ball missing leg stump and Younis survived.Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took six wickets as England were bowled out for 272 -- 67 runs behind on first innings.Shah�s haul of six for 72 was the best return by a visiting spinner against England at Lord�s since Sid Pegler�s seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912. <br/> Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.If Pakistan�s batsmen could give him enough runs to play with in a second innings, Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing surface.

Balochistan Sports Minister Mir Mujeebur Rehman announced a Rs0.5 million prize for Muhammad Waseem after his�victory.Initially it was an ordinary fight but WBC last month turned it into a world silver title fight. The victory catapults the 28-year-old Pakistani boxer among the top four in the world.Muhammad Waseem, who hails from Quetta, prepared for the fight under famous trainer Jeff Mayweather at the boxing club of renowned boxer Floyd Mayweather Junior in Las Vegas. Jeff is the uncle of Floyd Mayweather Junior, one of the world�s greatest boxers of his time.Waseem comes across as one of the most capable and promising young boxers that Pakistan has produced in recent times.Before this match, Waseem had played only three fights and won them all.The Pakistani boxer, who switched over to pro boxing early last year, made a dream debut when he knocked out.Korea�s Min Wook Lee in the ninth round to win the Korean Boxing Commission (KBC) title on October 4, 2015.He knocked out Suparyanto Doglo of Indonesia in the third round in his second bout in Bangkok on December 5, 2015.His last triumph came against Indonesia�s Bajawa whom he knocked out in Seoul the other month.Waseem is a rare fighter as he began his pro career directly with a ten-round fight.

sports,IOC vows toughest sanctions after report finds Moscow ran broad doping ,"strong>TORONTO: With the Rio Olympics less than three weeks away, the IOC on Monday promised ""the toughest sanctions available"" after a report found Moscow had concealed hundreds of positive doping tests in many sports ahead of the Sochi winter Games.</strongThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not spell out whether it would heed growing calls for Olympic bans already imposed on Russia's track and field athletes and weightlifters to be extended to all its competitors in Rio.However, IOC President Thomas Bach said the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) investigation had revealed ""a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games.The IOC Executive Board is to hold a telephone conference on Tuesday to take its first decisions, which may include provisional measures and sanctions with regard to the Rio Olympics.""Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated.""WADA itself explicitly urged the IOC to consider banning Russia from the Rio Olympics altogether.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who staked his reputation on the Sochi Games, the costliest in history, said the WADA-backed report was the result of political interference and that the Olympic movement could now split.The report confirmed allegations made by Grigory Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory.He told the New York Times two months ago that dozens of Russians had used performance-enhancing drugs in Sochi with the support not only of national sports authorities but even the domestic intelligence service, the FSB.Monday's report said Russia, a traditional sporting superpower, had been stung into action by its performance at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where it finished 11th, with only three gold medals.""The surprise result of the Sochi investigation was the revelation of the extent of State oversight and directed control of the Moscow Laboratory in processing and covering up urine samples of Russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the Sochi Games,"" said the report, unveiled in Toronto.strong>""FAILSAFE STRATEGY""</strongThe investigation was led by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren, who sat on the independent commission that last year exposed doping and corruption in Russian track and field, leading to its exclusion from international competition.The report said Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh had been advised of every positive test across all sports from 2011 onwards and decided ""who would benefit from a cover up and who would not be protected.""The State implemented a simple failsafe strategy,"" it said. ""If all the operational precautions to promote and permit doping by Russian athletes proved to have been ineffective for whatever reason, the laboratory provided a failsafe mechanism.""The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow Laboratory be altered.""Among the hundreds of samples that disappeared were 35 from Paralympic athletes.In Sochi itself, where international observers were scrutinizing the drug tests, positive results could not simply be brushed away, so the FSB developed a method of opening urine bottles to allow samples to be swapped undetected.Rodchenkov spoke of a clandestine night-time operation in which staff secretly took samples from the lab via a ""mouse hole"" cut into a wall, and replaced them with clean samples taken from the same athlete months earlier and sometimes manipulated.strong>""CREDIBLE WITNESSES""</strongMcLaren said Rodchenkov and all other witnesses interviewed had been deemed credible, and the report said the investigators ""confirm the general veracity of the published information concerning the sample swapping that went on at the Sochi Laboratory during the Sochi Games"".The investigations showed that caps had been removed from a number of samples, and that they contained unusually high levels of salt, ""significantly exceeding the levels produced by the human body"".Nagornykh and Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was mentioned 21 times in McLaren's 97-page report, were not immediately available for comment.Putin said in a statement that there was ""no place for doping in sport"", and that the officials named in the report would be suspended.Following the statement, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev suspended Deputy Sports Minister Nagornykh.Putin also said the allegations were based on the testimony of only one man, and were an attempt to ""make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure, to form a negative image of countries and peoples"".Harking back to the tit-for-tat superpower boycotts of the 1980s, he said: ""The Olympic movement ... may again be on the verge of a split.""In a leaked draft letter intended to be sent to the IOC on Monday, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart called for a ban on all Russian athletes, not only in track and field.Paul Melia, head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports, said the letter was backed by various athletes' committees and the anti-doping organisations of the United States, Germany, Japan and New Zealand, among others.However, Russian track and field athletes have appealed against their ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is due to rule by Thursday.If it finds in their favour, there would seem to be little chance of a wider ban on Russian competitors holding up.Bach had indicated last week that he was reluctant to see athletes from one sport punished for the crimes of athletes or officials from another.",7/19/2016,,
sports,Pakistan former bowler Saqlain to work with England spinner,"LONDON: England are seeking more regular help for their spinners after recruiting former Pakistan bowler Saqlain Mushtaq for the Old Trafford Test which starts on Friday.Saqlain linked up with England for practice in Manchester today and will work with spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, as well as advising batsmen how to play Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah.England have not had a permanent spin coach since Mushtaq Ahmed returned to Pakistan at the start of 2014 and they are keen to address the situation. It is thought a coach will join the squad for the winter tours of India and Bangladesh, where spin will be prominent.�Saqlain is one of the contenders for the role while Daniel Vettori, the former New Zealand left-arm spinner, recently spent time with the England Performance Programme at a training camp in Dubai. Robert Croft, who played 21 Tests, was recruited for a part of last winter�s tour of South Africa.�Mushtaq Ahmed worked closely with Graeme Swann during his time with England, helping Swann become one of the world�s best spinners. England know Moeen needs mentoring, especially as he has struggled to make an impression with the ball since England regained the Ashes last summer.Rashid has played only three Tests, against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last autumn, but is back in the squad for Old Trafford as England look to square the Investec Series, which Pakistan lead 1-0. Former England pace bowler Andrew Caddick will spend a day with the team before the Third Test at Edgbaston, which starts on August 3.Caddick has been invited for the training session on August 1, in which he will observe the session and work alongside England�s fast bowlers.�Caddick took 234 wickets in 62 Tests and was part of an effective new-ball combination with Darren Gough under the captaincy of Nasser Hussain. Meanwhile, England head selector James Whitaker is ready to clarify the role of his panel next week when he names the squad for the Third Test.

So it was good on that point and it was a massive confidence boost.""It seems a lot longer than it has been. I thought I was going to be back earlier than I was, purely because of how good the rehab was in the first few weeks. I am here now and I�m back fully fit.""England are 1-0 down in the four-match series and Stokes is in line for a recall to bolster the home side�s batting as much as for his lively pace bowling.""Losing is something that we can�t afford to do but we have have been playing some good Test cricket over the last two years,"" he said.""It�s one defeat, we are not taking it to heart, we�re just treating it as a three-match series and hoping we can win it.""",7/20/2016,,

An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the posting by the group presented a credible threat.ABIN last month confirmed it had detected a Portuguese account on the Telegram app that was a channel for exchanging information on Islamic State but authorities said no threat had been detected of an attack in Brazil.Since Thursday's attack in Nice where a truck ploughed through crowds during Bastille Day celebrations, Brazil has sought to reassure the international community that the Games will be safe and terrorist threats are being taken seriously.On Monday, interim President Michel Temer issued a video message inviting foreigners to come to Rio and enjoy the Games and the beauty of the host city.""We have reinforced security very much in the city and you can come without worries.

sports,Ashwin century follows Kohli doub,"NORTH SOUND, Antigua: Virat Kohli continued his efficient and energetic accumulation of runs to bring up his maiden first-class double hundred, but his dismissal in the first over after lunch brought West Indies some relief as 108 came off 35 overs in the second session.Promoted to No. 6, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck in the first hour of the day before strolling to his third hundred against West Indies, taking his average against them to 76.2.Kohli's intent - helped no doubt by a flat pitch and tiring bowlers - foiled West Indies' plan pretty much from ball one: bowl defensively and ensure your stacked-up batting line-up has less time to survive. Kohli himself batted at 4.2 an over.Apart from Shannon Gabriel, no bowler - there was only one more specialist in the side - actively looked out for wickets, relying on frustrating batsmen. However, captain Kohli, India's first to score an away double, took risks and made the bowlers bowl to him because he was driving the wide ones too.Gabriel, though, should have had a wicket added to his one from day one early on the second day. Shane Dowrich had waited for 423 overs over three Tests for his first opportunity for a dismissal, but Gabriel produced the outside edge from Ashwin for a sitter, his eagerness to celebrate led to the sitter's being grassed. West Indies still managed to keep Ashwin quiet - at one point he went 40 balls for four runs - but Kohli kept finding a way around the defensive lines.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.Slow pitch, fielders in front, no pace to work with, and West Indies finally had a quiet session. Ashwin didn't look in any hurry, Wriddhiman Saha tried to break the monotony, succeeding on a couple of occasions before getting stumped to finally give Dowrich a maiden Test dismissal. Overall, though, West Indies refused to attack, which could also give India scoring opportunities, and India didn't seem overly bothered with the slow going.Seven minutes before tea, with a back-foot punch through midwicket, Ashwin brought up his hundred, reminding you of the shot of the day, a back-foot punch through mid-on for four.

sports,Russia facing Rio Paralympic b,"PARIS: Russia could miss the Paralympics in Rio as well as the Olympics after the International Paralympic Committee decided Friday to open suspension proceedings following a damning report into state-sponsored doping.The IPC said that in light of this week�s McLaren report, it expected to announce a decision on whether or not it will suspend Russia in the week commencing August 1.""In light of the prevailing doping culture endemic within Russian sport, at the very highest levels, National Paralympic Committee of Russia (NPC) appears unable or unwilling to ensure compliance with and the enforcement of the IPC�s Anti-Doping Code within its own national jurisdiction,"" said a statement from the world governing body.""The IPC considers this vital to ensuring athletes are able to compete on a level playing field.""The suspension of NPC Russia will now be considered in accordance with the IPC Suspension Policy. That process will include, amongst other things, appropriate dialogue with NPC Russia in order to afford them due process and to allow them to present their case.""The IPC said they have been provided with the names of the Paralympic athletes associated with the 35 ""disappearing positive samples"" from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory which were highlighted in McLaren�s report.They are also sending 19 samples from the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi for immediate further analysis, after they were identified as having been potentially doctored as part of a sample-swapping regime.Should Russia be suspended they will have 21 days to appeal the decision.<br/> The Paralympics take place in Rio from September 7 to 18.""The McLaren report revealed an unimaginable scale of institutionalised doping in Russian sport that was orchestrated at the highest level. McLaren�s findings are of serious concern for everyone committed to clean and honest sport,"" said Philip Craven, the IPC president.""With regard to NPC Russia, we have started proceedings to consider the suspension of their membership of the IPC.""This decision was not taken lightly, but after fully evaluating the report and the additional information we have received, the IPC believes that the current environment in Russian sport -- which stems from the highest levels -- is such that NPC Russia appears unable to fulfil its IPC membership obligations in full.""�",7/22/2016,,
sports,Cook Root tons help England reach 314 4 against Paki,"MANCHESTER: Joe Root�s unbeaten 141 was the centrepiece of England�s commanding 314 for four on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford on Friday.England captain Alastair Cook, who won the toss on a good pitch and in sunny conditions ideal for batting, made 105 and shared a second-wicket stand of 185 with Root.Having twice got himself out during England�s 75-run defeat by Pakistan in the first of a four-Test series at Lord�s last week, a determined Root did not give a chance in just over six hours at the crease on Friday.Pakistan�s left-arm pace trio of Mohammad Amir, Rahat Ali and Wahab Riaz became increasingly threatening as the skies clouded over late on.<br/> Amir took two for 63 and Rahat two for 69, with both men bowling 20 overs on Friday.But star leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who took a man-of-the-match winning 10 wickets at Lord�s, returned figures of none for 111 in 31 overs.Amir had opener Alex Hales dropped in the gully on six by Asad Shafiq.<br/> But three balls later, having repeatedly moved the ball away from Hales, Amir skilfully swung the ball back into the right-handed opener and knocked over his middle and off stumps.England were now 25 for one after seven overs.At lunch, England were 95 for one with Cook 40 not out and Root 41 not out.<br/> <br/> Root just beat Cook to the fifty milestone, getting there in 86 balls to the captain�s 90. Cook reached the landmark in style with a straight-driven four -- a clear sign he is in top form -- off Shah.A similar stroke saw him into the 90s and raised the 150 stand. <br/> Cook�s two to mid-wicket off Amir saw him to a hundred in 157 balls including 14 fours and the normally restrained Essex batsman celebrated his century with several fist pumps.Left-handed opener Cook�s 29th Test century meant he extended his own England record and drew the Essex batsman level with Australia great Don Bradman�s tally.<br/> Bradman, however, played just 52 Tests while this was Cook�s 131st match in the format.More signficantly, this was Cook�s first century in 20 Test innings since his monumental 263 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in October.But Amir then took the shine off an excellent session for England by bowling Cook following an under-edge from a ball that kept low.That became the last delivery before tea, with England 210 for two at the interval.James Vince, looking for a maiden Test fifty to cement his place in the side, fell in all too familiar fashion when, on 18, he chased a wide Rahat delivery outside off stump, with his edged drive caught low down by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.What made his dismissal all the worse wast that Vince had been dropped by Younis Khan in the slips off a similar shot when on six off Amir.Root, 87 not out at tea, went to his 10th hundred in 44 Tests with his 14th four in 167 balls when he drove Shah wide of mid-on in textbook fashion.Gary Ballance (23) then helped Yorkshire team-mate Root add on 73 before he chopped on against Rahat.England have not lost a home Test batting first since 2012, a sequence encompassing 10 wins and two draws.",7/22/2016,,
sports,Kohlis first double takes India past 400 against Windi,"NORTH SOUND, Antigua: Virat Kohli continued his efficient and energetic accumulation of runs to bring up his maiden first-class double hundred, which took India past 400 in the first session of the second day.This was the first away double-century by an India captain. In a wicketless session that went for 102 runs, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck but also displayed some attractive shots; a back-foot punch for four through mid-on was the shot of the session. The partnership between the two swelled to 168.As was the case on day one, Gabriel bowled a short burst with the new ball, which was taken first thing in the morning. He tested Ashwin, who was dropped on 43 by Dowrich, who looked like he was already thinking of celebrating even before completing the simple catch. Jason Holder looked unremarkable at the other end; Carlos Brathwaite did a better job of testing the batsmen's patience with consistent bowling a set of stumps outside off stump.The tactic had kept India's top order quiet in the first session of the match, but Kohli didn't wait for too long before taking a calculated risk, which was executed so well it didn't look like a risk. Kohli has his own way of choosing what balls to drive. Each delivery of Brathwaite's first three overs was bowled to Kohli, who attempted to score off only one, the widest of the lot. It wasn't a half-volley either, but Kohli drove superbly on the up, and got a boundary to break any pressure the joining of dots creates.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.No Test double is easy, but in the last over before lunch, Kohli strolled to one of the more inevitable ones with an easy single off a short offbreak. Ashwin, who has two centuries against West Indies to his name, was now looking comfortable with 64 runs at a Test average of 67.80 against West Indies.�",7/22/2016,,
sports,Kohli puts India in charge with 12th Test century,"North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: �Virat Kohli stroked a commanding 12th Test century to put India in control at 302 for four when stumps were drawn on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies on Thursday.Having chosen to bat first on winning the toss, the Indian captain led the way with a thoroughly authoritative innings of 143 not out, decorated with 16 fours that has so far occupied just over four hours off 197 deliveries.He put on 105 for the third wicket with Shikhar Dhawan, the opening batsman missing out on a three-figure innings of his own when he fell lbw for 84 sweeping at Devendra Bishoo on the stroke of the tea interval.Bishoo ended the day with figures of three for 108 off 27 overs. Surprisingly he was not called upon by his captain, Jason Holder, in the first period of play, when even debutant batsman and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase delivered eight overs.However his dismissal of Pujara via a horribly miscued pull in the first over after lunch ushered in Kohli who proceeded to transform the rest of the day into a testament to his ever-increasing stature as a batsman of the highest class.Gabriel removed Murali Vijay for just seven after half-an-hour�s play when the right-hander fended at a lifting delivery for Kraigg Brathwaite to take the catch at the second attempt at second slip.Pujara looked untroubled on joining Dhawan at the crease with the pair putting on 60 before the middle-order player�s error of judgement at the start of the afternoon session.Having opted to go into the match without uncapped fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins, the only other pace threat available in the West Indies pre-match squad of 13, it was left to Holder, fellow medium-pacer Carlos Brathwaite and Chase to do the bulk of the early work in support of Gabriel before Bishoo got into his work after lunch.Early in his innings, Kohli passed 3,000 career Test runs and later on reached 1,000 as Test captain. But the most important figures were the partnerships built around his excellent innings.His century stand with Dhawan was followed by a further 60 put together with Rahane followed by a fifth-wicket stand so far worth 66 with Ravichandran Ashwin.With two Test centuries against the West Indies on the Indian sub-continent, the lower-order player will resume on the second morning unbeaten on 22 alongside Kohli.While the West Indies have packed their side with batting, India opted for a bowling attack comprising three pacers and two spinners, omitting Ravindra Jadeja in preference for Amit Mishra to work in tandem with Ashwin as specialist slow bowlers.West Indies have not defeated India in Test cricket for 14 years since the end of the 2002 series in the Caribbean and are the decided underdogs for the first meeting with these opponents on home soil for five years.�",7/22/2016,,

England were now 25 for one after seven overs.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah, England�s tormentor-in-chief at Lord�s with 10 wickets, saw his second ball Friday cut in front of point by Root for four. That shot brought up England�s fifty in 92 balls with 10 boundaries.Root, in the manner of Yorkshire and England great Geoffrey Boycott, forced both Wahab Riaz and Amir through cover-point off the back foot for fours as he and his skipper looked to make the most of an even-paced pitch in sunny conditions ideal for batting.�� ",7/22/2016,,

sports,Brazil arrests 10 for amateur terror plot against Olympi,"strong>BRASILIA: Brazil arrested 10 people on Thursday suspected of belonging to a poorly organised group supporting Islamic State (IS) and discussing terrorist acts during the next month's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</strongThe group, described as ""absolutely amateur"" by Justice Minister Alexandre Moraes, were all Brazilian citizens and in contact via messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. They did not know each other personally, the minister said.The arrests came a week after a truck massacre in Nice, France, and amid growing fears of a possible attack when the first Olympics to be held in South America kicks off on Aug. 5. Some 500,000 visitors are expected to travel to Brazil for the Games, many of them from the United States.Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, Moraes said the Games had made the Latin American country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting IS.""Today was the first operation against a supposed terrorist cell in Brazil,"" he told a news conference. ""Brazil was not part of the coalition against IS but, because of the upcoming Olympics and because it will receive many foreigners, Brazil has become a target.""Moraes said the individuals detained on Thursday were being monitored because they had accessed websites linked to IS, but the group had ""no preparation at all"" and was a ""disorganized cell"". He said that authorities intervened when the group started planning actions including martial-arts training and the purchase of firearms.While the group did not have direct contact with IS, some members had made ""pro forma"" declarations of allegiance to the militant Islamist group via social media, the minister said.A presidential aide said on Thursday that Brazilian police and intelligence services had cooperated with French, German, British, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies in the arrests.Brazil's federal police are monitoring around 100 people for possible links to terrorist groups, mostly in the lawless tri-border region with Paraguay and Argentina, said the aide, requesting anonymity.""Brazil was really being preemptive in this case,"" said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical analysis at Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm. ""There are some tactical benefits to arrests like this...You could disrupt anything in the works and it may also give other people pause.""strong>OPERATION HASHTAG</strongBrazil plans to deploy about 85,000 soldiers, police and other security personnel during the Rio Games, more than twice as many in place for the London Olympics in 2012.It will also operate a joint security centre where representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to help share intelligence and monitor the event.Local media raised concern that the arrests might affect ticket sales for the Games, with the release of 100,000 tickets on Thursday aimed at improving attendance.The local Olympic organising committee, Rio 2016, referred requests for comment to the federal government.Moraes said there was no evidence that the group had acquired weapons though one member had contacted a clandestine weapons site in neighbouring Paraguay that sells AK-47 assault rifles.""Those involved participated in an online group denominated 'the defenders of Sharia' and were planning to acquire weapons to commit crimes in Brazil and even overseas,"" Moraes said.Two people will be brought in for questioning, including the head of a local NGO, in addition to the 10 people arrested across as many states, Moraes added.Federal Judge Marcos Josegrei da Silva, who approved the arrests from the southern city of Curitiba, said police had 30 days to analyse evidence. He emphasized that no-one had been charged in the operation, codenamed Hashtag.""These are internet affirmations on social networks,"" Josegrei told a news conference. ""Not everything a person conceives of in the virtual world is carried out in the real world.""Interim President Michel Temer called an emergency cabinet meeting following the arrests, the first under Brazil's tough new anti-terrorism law approved this year.Brazilian and U.S. officials have raised concern over the disappearance of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Jihad Diyab, after he had resettled in neighbouring Uruguay, saying he could now be in Brazil.Last week, Brazil deported a French-Algerian nuclear physicist convicted by a Paris court in 2012 for his involvement in helping to plot an attack in France in 2009 with an al Qaeda militant in Algeria.Brazil's intelligence agency said on Tuesday it was investigating all threats to the Rio Olympics, after a previously unknown Brazilian Islamist group calling itself ""Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil"" pledged allegiance to IS. It was unclear whether those detained on Thursday have any relation with that group.On Wednesday, SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. company that monitors the internet, said alleged Islamist militants were giving advice for lone actors to carry out attacks during the Games, including the use of toy drones. The messages are being sent via the mobile messaging system Telegram, SITE said.Stratfor's Stewart said that, with no ability to project terrorist operatives into Brazil, IS could only seek to encourage grassroots groups. Brazil has one of the world's largest Arab diasporas, mostly Christians of Syrian and Lebanese origins.After last week's attack in Nice, France, Brazilian authorities said they would step up security measures for the Games by adding further roadblocks and cordons and frisking more visitors in Rio de Janeiro.

They stuck to their plans very well. It was never easy batting against them.""Rajendra Chandrika and Darren Bravo survived to the close and will resume on the fourth day hoping to put up a much more concerted effort than in the first innings.In their previous three Test series, the West Indies lost the opening matches at home to Australia by nine wickets a year ago and then by an innings in Sri Lanka and Australia at the end of 2015.India�s bowlers made a mockery of all the lamentations of a placid, lifeless pitch over the first two days with an impressive, purposeful effort throughout the day.They were held up though at the start of play as Braithwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo frustrated Virat Kohli and his men for 75 minutes until leg-spinner Amit Mishra had Bishoo stumped by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.It was second of six dismissals for Saha in the innings, putting him alongside Syed Kirmani and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test innings.From that point on it became a virtual procession of West Indies batsmen to and from the wicket with Shami outstanding either side of the lunch interval when he disposed of Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood to add to his dismissal of Chandrika late on the second evening.Debutant Roston Chase displayed a measure of grit in a 47-run stand for the sixth wicket with Brathwaite, but the reintroduction of Yadav for another spell in mid-afternoon proved telling.Chase miscued an attempted pull to give Kohli a simple catch at short midwicket and Brathwaite could not get out of the way of a sharp lifter to give a catch behind.Dowrich counter-attacked superbly in getting to an unbeaten 57 with ten fours by the time the innings folded, Yadav dispensing with Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite off successive balls before Mishra completed the job by bowling a heaving Shannon Gabriel.",7/24/2016,,

On receiving the mace, a pleased Smith said: ""It is a huge honour to be the number-one ranked Test side in the world and the credit should go to all the work the players and support staff have put in over the last 12 months.""I am really proud of our young team and what we have accomplished so far but there is still more we would like to achieve. We now need to put in consistent performances, both at home and away, to continue to be successful and keep the number-one ranking.""Winning away from home has often been a challenge for us, especially in sub-continental conditions, but this is something we are looking to change in this upcoming series against Sri Lanka,"" concluded Smith.Given the small margin of gap between the top-four sides, several permutations exist for India, Pakistan and England to usurp Australia. Second-placed India (112) are breathing down Australia's neck with just six points separating the two teams. Pakistan are third on 111, while England lie fourth, on 108 points. To keep a hold on the top spot, Australia need at least a 1-0 win over Sri Lanka, and need England to beat Pakistan in at least one Test.For India to pip Australia, however, they will need to beat West Indies 4-0 and hope the England-Pakistan series ends in a draw and also Sri Lanka wins by 1-0 or a better margin.Pakistan can claim the top spot for the first time in history if they beat England and Sri Lanka beats Australia.For England, it seems a bit of an uphill climb as, they will need to beat Pakistan in the remaining three Tests, apart from needing West Indies to beat India in at least one Test. They'll also need Sri Lanka to beat Australia.�",7/25/2016,,

The way we finished the test, it all panned out pretty nicely.""While Kohli has led India to a test series win in Sri Lanka and beat South Africa 3-0 at home, their record outside South Asia in the longest format has been poor.They have lost series in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia on tours since late 2013, something new coach Anil Kumble has said he wants to rectify.The 27-year-old Kohli replaced Mahendra Singh Dhoni as India's test captain after the wicketkeeper-batsman retired from that form of cricket during the tour of Australia in late 2014.Kohli wants his side, who are currently second behind Australia on the International Cricket Council test rankings, to target consistency as well as wins.""If we have a chance to win 4-0, then why not,"" Kohli said. ""We don't need to get complacent. If we end up getting a 2-0 lead, it's not that we would be playing for a draw in the next two tests.""As we know, if we learn to win test matches, then we'll learn how to win tests everywhere.""We will learn how to play in different situations and we will know exactly what to do when a certain situation is going a certain way.""",7/25/2016,,

I was again tested on my return on the 25th of June and once again on the fifth of July.""Yadav's Olympic berth was put in jeopardy when Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in the 66kg category in Beijing in 2008 and silver in London, moved up a weight and sought a court order for a bout between the pair to determine who should go to Rio.Last month, the Delhi High Court ruled against Kumar, the only Indian athlete to win two individual Olympic medals, clearing the way for Yadav to compete in Rio.The qualification row divided opinion in the country and Yadav was provided police security, a rare measure for an Indian athlete, at the Sports Authority of India training centre at Sonepat due to possible threats to his life.The Wrestling Federation of India has also not dismissed the possibility of the failed test coming as a result of subversion, according to local media.""I believe that there is foul play involved in this entire episode,"" said Yadav, who won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. ""Someone has sabotaged my food supplements and water intake.""I am a responsible athlete with an understanding of the country's expectations and hopes on me. I would never dream of betraying that hope.""NADA Director General Navin Agarwal confirmed that the wrestler's room mate and training partner, Sandeep Yadav, has also tested positive for the same substance, which Indian media has reported to be the banned anabolic steroid methandienone.""The foul play allegations are out of our jurisdiction,"" Agarwal told Reuters by telephone.

There have been previous attempts to popularise the sport through games involving retired international stars, playing at baseball venues, but Russell believes the demographics mean there is no real need to convert Americans to the sport.""As well as the Caribbean diaspora, you have the Asian population here who are cricket-starved,"" he added.While no plans for the future have been announced it is unlikely that this week�s games, featuring all six franchises, will be the last time that the CPL features at Lauderhill.""We have invested well over a million dollars in coming to Florida.

sports,England prepare for Stokes setb,"strong>Manchester: England were waiting to discover on Tuesday if they would be without Ben Stokes for the third Test against Pakistan as coach Trevor Bayliss insisted they could cope with the absence of the key all-rounder.</strongStokes suffered a calf injury while bowling on Monday as England closed in on a mammoth 330-run win in the second Test at Old Trafford to level the four-match series at 1-1.The sight of a grimacing Stokes slowly walking off the field in Manchester suggested that, at the very least, the Durham star would struggle to be fit for the third Test at Birmingham�s Edgbaston ground which gets underway a week on Wednesday.Doing without Stokes, however, is something England have got used to in a season where he has started only two out of five Tests and has not finished one.A left knee injury cut short Stokes�s participation in the first Test against Sri Lanka in May and left the 25-year-old needing surgery which saw him miss the final two Tests of that series, as well as the subsequent one-dayers and lone Twenty20.But in Stokes�s absence, Warwickshire�s Chris Woakes -- also a pace-bowling all-rounder -- seized the chance to revive an international career that appeared to have come to a halt, producing an impressive series of performances with both bat and ball.Nevertheless, England coach Trevor Bayliss remains well aware of Stokes�s value to the team.<br/>""If he does miss out, it will give someone else an opportunity,"" said Bayliss at Old Trafford following England�s commanding victory at Lancashire�s headquarters.""Yes, he�s a big player for us -- he adds a lot of spark to the team. ""He bats, bowls and he�s a leader in the field -- so it is a bit of a hole. ""But Woakes has done brilliantly so far this season, so we are lucky in that aspect.""/>�<strong>No Vince guarantee</strong> />England captain Alastair Cook and Joe Root made more than 500 runs between them in Manchester, with vice-captain Root making a Test-best 254 in a first-innings where his skipper posted a century.As Bayliss pointed out, all teams are reliant on their best batsmen. But, ideally, England would like the two other members of their top four, opener Alex Hales and James Vince, to shoulder a larger share of the burden.Hampshire captain Vince has yet to make a Test fifty in seven innings and was once more caught off an edged drive, for 18, at Old Trafford.""I don�t see there�s any reason to panic just at the moment,"" said Bayliss. ""As I said after the last game, though, runs will count.The Australian added: ""I�m sure (Vince�s place) will come up for discussion before Edgbaston.<br/>""Yes, I�d like to see people given a little bit more of an extra go. But we�ve never put a quantity on it -- never said �five Tests, six Tests, seven Tests�, or whatever it might be.""It will be a little bit of a gut feel... if there�s someone else that warrants a place to replace a player like that.""Bayliss said Vince�s offside problems were comparable to batsmen unable to resist hooking.<br/>""We�ve probably all seen it before -- the �happy hooker�, (you tell him to) give the hook shot away.""It might get you out a few times, but it scores you a lot of runs. So what do you do?<br/>""His cover-drive is one of his better shots.""We�ve spoken about it, just letting a few more balls go and let the bowlers come to him before he plays his favourite shot.""It�s obviously only a split-second to make that decision, but he�s fully aware of it.""",7/27/2016,,

This was Sri Lanka�s only second Test win against Australia in 27 matches.It was batsman Mendis (176) who set up the unlikely win for Sri Lanka with his superb maiden ton in his team�s second innings after the hosts overcame an 86-run deficit.The 21-year-old Mendis, the only centurion in a low-scoring contest, played a memorable 254-ball knock laced with 21 fours and a six.For Lankan spinners it was a race against time as rain threatened to thwart their chances of upsetting firm favourites Australia but Herath had other ideas in mind.<br/> <br/> The left-arm spinner, who grabbed four wickets in the first innings, made life miserable for the Australian batsmen on a turning track on the fifth morning.Smith, whose 55 was the next best after Mendis� century, was trapped LBW by Herath as Australia slipped to 141 for seven at lunch.Debutant chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan, who bagged seven wickets in the match, provided the perfect foil to Herath�s experience.O�Keefe, who was ruled out of the remainder of the series after injuring his hamstring Thursday, surprised the opposition by turning up at the crease Saturday.O�Keefe and Nevill resisted stoutly with one eye on the skies but could only delay the inevitable.Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0 as the action shifts to Galle for the second Test beginning August 4.�",7/30/2016,,
sports,DayNight Test in England moves closer with tri,"strong>LONDON: Prospects of day/night Test cricket being staged in England moved closer to reality on Friday with a trial announced by Warwickshire next month.</strongThe county club will stage one of their Second XI fixtures under lights at Edgbaston.The August 22-24 fixture against Worcestershire 2nd XI has been moved from Barnt Green to Warwickshire�s Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham, which has permanent floodlights.Australia won the inaugural day/night Test when they beat New Zealand by three wickets in Adelaide in November last year.Doubts, however, remain about the visibility of the pink ball used in floodlit Tests -- the standard red ball does not show up well under the floodlights and the white ball used for one-day matches could get �lost� when players are in their traditional �whites� for Test cricket.There are also particular concerns about whether day/night Tests are necessary in England, when much of the cricket season takes place when the hours of natural daylight are the longest in the year.Nevertheless, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Colin Graves remains keen on the idea and officials at Lord�s are keen to look into the subject, as are leading ball manufacturers Dukes and Kookaburra.Both firms will provide a pink ball for the 2nd XI fixture, with each used for two innings of the match, which will be free to the public.Alan Fordham, the ECB�s head of cricket operations, said: ""Staging first-class matches under lights with a pink ball is a format which has worked well elsewhere in the cricketing world and it�s important we consider ways in which we can attract more people to first-class cricket in the long term.""We�ll be monitoring this trial match closely and we would like to thank Warwickshire for their support in hosting the fixture.""Neil Snowball, Warwickshire�s chief executive, added: ""The concept of day/night cricket has attracted a large amount of interest around the world and we are keen to support the ECB by exploring the potential for these fixtures in England and Wales.""We have a long tradition of staging day-night cricket on this ground and this trial game will provide valuable insights for everyone interested in broadening the audience for our first class game.""Edgbaston hosted the first ever day/night limited-overs match in Britain in 1997, under temporary lights.But the Birmingham ground now has permanent floodlights and is seen as the most likely venue should England play a home day/night Test.",7/30/2016,,
sports,Premier League transfer fees poised to break record,"strong>LONDON: With one month of the transfer window left remaining, Premier League clubs are poised to push escalating fees closer to another new record this week.</strongThe projected move of France midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus back to Manchester United for a world record one hundred million pounds ($132.3 million) would take spending by the 20 teams to almost 600m, adding to the 175m recorded by accountancy firm Deloitte in the January window.Last year was the first in which annual fees reached one billion pounds.So far this close-season Arsenal -- criticised in the past by many supporters for not spending enough -- have recorded the highest individual outlay by paying 35 million pounds for Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka.But Pogba's proposed return to Old Trafford would dwarf that and all other sums in the history of the sport, smashing the world record of 85.3 million pounds that Real Madrid paid for Wales forward Gareth Bale three years ago.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is among those who are bemused by how high fees have risen but still believes there is no longer any limit.""Since I've been in the sport I always thought it can't go any higher up and I've always been wrong,"" he told reporters.""Maybe it will be 200 or 300m, who knows?""Trevor Francis, the first million-pound player in English football back in 1979, said he was surprised the new world record might be set by a midfield player.""I really thought if (100m) was paid, it was going to be for a striker who could be a match-winner and probably provide you with 30 goals a season,"" he told BBC Radio.""Possibly the only two I thought could command that figure were Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi because people realise they are exceptional talents that will go down in the history of the game.""strong>BROADCASTING DEAL</strongWith a lucrative new broadcasting deal coming into effect this season and new managers taking over at Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs, it is perhaps not surprising that a spending spree has materialised.Under Antonio Conte, Italy's head coach at Euro 2016.�Chelsea paid more than 30 million pounds for beach of Marseille's Michy Batshuayi and Leicester City's N'Golo Kante.The fee for Kante, who helped Leicester become surprise Premier League champions, clearly illustrated football's inflation rate -- a year ago the midlands club paid barely one-sixth as much for him.Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was always likely to spend big in attempting to revive Manchester United, with Pogba expected to become his fourth major signing.Ironically, the most exciting of them could be Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who arrived on a free transfer from Paris St Germain and scored a spectacular goal on Saturday four minutes into his debut.Pep Guardiola, having already spent 35 million pounds at Manchester City, was reported by British media on Sunday to be on the verge of almost doubling that by signing German forward Leroy Sane from Schalke 04.At the other end of the spectrum, Burnley and managerless Hull City, two of the newly promoted clubs, have hardly begun recruiting.Once they do over the next 31 days, the amount of money shelled out will only increase.�",7/31/2016,,

The Serb evaluated his play as his best of the week.�It came at the right time,� Djokovic said in a courtside interview. �You never know what is going to come the other way from a guy who has been in top form in the last couple of weeks.�He won in Washington last week and came in here and won comfortably in most of his matches. I had to stay committed from the beginning and I�m very, very pleased with the way I played.�Djokovic is 9-2 against Nishikori and has won their last eight meetings, including the hard-court final in Miami earlier this year.�Playing against Kei is never easy,� Djokovic said. �He�s been around. He�s an established top-five, top-10 player. He�s one of the quickest on tour and I�m going to have some fun.�Nishikori is seeking his first ATP Masters 1000 title after reaching the third final of his career in the elite events.""I knew I would have to step it up a little bit in the second set the first couple of games,"" Nishikori said after beating Wawrinka for just the second time in five meetings.""And after that, I tried to be more aggressive and really concentrate because he was a little bit down and I knew if I had to let him, he's going to come back.�Wawrinka, a two-times grand slam champion who has won 14 ATP World Tour titles, became increasingly dispirited as he lost 11 of the last 13 games after squandering four set points in that opening set.Nishikori, serving at 40-0, sealed victory on the first of his three match points when an overhead smash prompted an unforced error from his opponent, ending an encounter that lasted just under an hour-and-a-half.",7/31/2016,,

He then held on for the win as Santa Cruz gained steam in the middle rounds before the two closed it out by exchanging punches in the middle of the ring as the final bell sounded.Frampton, who was born in Belfast, improved to 23-0 with 14 knockouts as he had to overcome a height advantage after moving up to fight at a higher weight class.One judge scored it even, 114-114, while the other two gave it to Frampton 117-111 and 116-112 in front of a crowd of about 8,000 at the Barclays Center arena.Frampton previously held the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight titles.Frampton punctuated his impressive early round performance by staggering the champion in the second round with a left hook.

""He always said �I didn�t go to the Berlin Olympics to shake Hitler�s hand�,"" the 77-year-old daughter told magazine Sport Bild.<br/>""�I went there to run.

sports,Windies top order collapses as India hunt victory,"KINGSTON, Jamaica: West Indies� vulnerable top-order crumbled again in between the showers to be 48 for four in their second innings at lunch on the rain-affected fourth day of the second Test against India at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Tuesday.Trailing on first innings by 304 runs after the tourists reached 500 for nine declared at tea on the third day, the hosts go into the afternoon session still facing a deficit of 256 runs to avoid a second consecutive innings defeat in the four-match series.Frustrated by a weather system that erased the final session on day three and delayed the start of play on the fourth morning for over an hour, India�s varied attack made up for the lost time by again exploiting the glaring weaknesses of the West Indies batsmen.With his place in the team on the line after a succession of low scores in his fledgling Test career, Rajendra Chandrika was the first to go, bowled for one by a delivery that made extra height from tall fast bowler Ishant Sharma and rebounded off the batsman�s right elbow onto the stumps as he attempted to pull out of the shot.His opening partner, Kraigg Brathwaite, and new batsman Darren Bravo were peppered with regular short-pitched bowling from both Sharma and Mohammed Shami.Bravo in particular was lucky to survive the concerted assault but at the other end, the introduction of Amit Mishra broke the 36-run stand when Brathwaite, on 23, miscued an attempted pull off the leg-spinner for Lokesh Rahul to take the catch running back from midwicket.Marlon Samuels was comprehensively bowled by Shami with no addition to the total and off what proved to be the last delivery before the interval, Bravo failed to negotiate another lifting delivery angled into the body and Rahul held the catch at third slip to remove the left-hander for 20.In losing three wickets for seven runs at the end of the truncated session, in which only 15.5 overs were bowled, the West Indies exactly replicated their predicament at the start of the match when their captain, Jason Holder, won the toss and chose to bat first.Roston Chase, who claimed five wickets with his off-spinners in India�s marathon innings, was expected to join Jermaine Blackwood at the crease in the afternoon session with the home side in desperate need of some meaningful resistance, and more realistically significant intervention from the weather, to avoid another innings defeat inside four days.",8/2/2016,,

""The players are also unhappy that, after an outstanding performance, you were nowhere in the next game.""But you have to give credit to the opposition that they played so outstandingly that it put you out of the match.""Both Arthur and Misbah are determined to instill a team culture in a squad whose last tour of England in 2010 saw Pakistan bowled out just 72 in their first innings of that year�s Edgbaston Test.""I think it�s important that we should set a trend -- no one is bigger than the game.""We have to understand that and be disciplined. No matter who the player is, even if it�s me and if my priority is something else, then I should not be in the team.""As for that 2010 reverse, Misbah -- who wasn�t even in the squad at the time -- said: ""I think if you keep the past in mind you can�t move ahead - obviously it�s a new game, new pitch and a different team.""So whatever challenges come before us... we have to focus on them, not worry or think about 2010 or before.""",8/2/2016,,
sports,Pakistan hopes to replicate Lords performance at Edgb,"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan will look to bounce back from a crushing defeat in Manchester when it faces England in the third Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham from Wednesday.Pakistan began the four-match series with an impressive 75-run win in the first Test at Lord�s but England hit back to level things up with a 330-run win in the second Test at Old Trafford.The first Test saw an inspiring century from captain Misbah-ul-Haq but Pakistan�s performance in the next game betrayed its batting woes.The concerns start right at the top, with Shan Masood and Mohammad Hafeez struggling in English conditions. Masood in particular has had a tough time against James Anderson, falling to the pacer six times in 57 balls since the two teams� met in the United Arab Emirates last year.Naturally, Mickey Arthur, the Pakistan coach, called for a better effort from his top-order batsmen but was tight-lipped about possible changes to the side.<br/> <br/> ""I was really disappointed with our performance at Old Trafford -- really disappointed,"" said Arthur. ""There are credible losses, and there are losses when you lie down and are steamrollered ... Old Trafford was clearly that. I told the guys I thought we were warriors at Lord�s. We were completely the opposite at Old Trafford.<br/> <br/> ""We�ve had discussions (on team changes). We�ve given that position some serious thought. We�re very clear on what we�re going to do this Test, but it�s not for public consumption. It has been a worry.""However, it�s not just Pakistan whose batting appears vulnerable. England too has a shaky batting line-up dependent heavily on Alastair Cook and Joe Root, who both made hundreds at Old Trafford.James Vince and Gary Ballance are both under pressure to cement their respective places while Alex Hales has managed just 56 runs from four innings in the series. <br/> <br/> The home side will also be without the services of Ben Stokes, who was ruled out with a calf injury suffered at Old Trafford. His absence means England could play two spinners with Adil Rashid, the leg-spinner, waiting in the wings for a home debut in support of off-spinner Moeen Ali.England, though, will be encouraged by the superb form of Chris Woakes, who has taken 26 wickets and scored 221 runs in four Tests this season.""I was thinking �I can do it at first-class level, why am I not showing it at the next level?"" said Woakes. ""You obviously have doubts about yourself ... but it�s amazing what six months can do for you.""For Pakistan, Yasir Shah, the leg-spinner, is likely to be the key bowler on a pitch that is expected to assist spin. Yasir took 10 wickets at Lord�s but only managed one at Old Trafford.",8/2/2016,,

Pakistan knocked down the first of those pillars when Root, playing one of his favourite back-foot forcing shots, edged Sohail and was held by sometimes fallible slip fielder Mohammad Hafeez for just three.Left-handed opener Cook, carrying on from where he left off in Manchester, made 45 in 52 balls, including eight fours before Rahat Ali had him lbw.James Vince guided England to 100 for three at lunch. But on 39, an uncertain defensive prod outside off stump against Sohail saw Vince, yet to mae a fifty in his eight Test innings, edge low to second slip Younis Khan.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a dire position in recent times.<br/> But he made just 12 before, trying to cut a sharply bouncing Sohail delivery, he was caught behind by opposing wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Ballance, increasingly assured after a shaky start, hit 11 fours. But his 150-ball innings ended when a glance off leg-spinner Yasir Shah was well held by Ahmed, who made good ground to hold the tough chance in an example of Pakistan�s much-improved catching. Ballance�s exit ended a sixth-wicket stand of 66 with Ali.Chris Woakes, on his Warwickshire home ground, was then caught behind for nine off an excellent Rahat inswinger.Mohammad Amir, who appeared to be nursing a calf problem, then struck twice with the new ball, including removing Ali when the batsman�s loose drive saw Ahmed hold his fifth catch of the innings.Sohail, appropriately, ended the day�s play when had No 11 James Anderson lbw for five.

sports,Sohail stars for Pakistan against England,"BIRMINGHAM: Sohail Khan marked his return to Test cricket after a five-year absence with four wickets as Pakistan reduced England to 184 for five at tea on the first day of the third Test at Edgbaston on Wednesday.The 32-year-old right-arm quick removed a quartet of top-order batsman -- Alex Hales, Joe Root, James Vince and Jonny Bairstow -- on his way to tea figures of four for 61 in 16 overs.It was a return made all the more impressive as Sohail�s previous two Tests -- against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2009 and against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2011 -- had yielded a combined haul of one for 245.A stress fracture of the back after last year�s World Cup provided a further check on his progress.Nevertheless, Sohail was recalled in place of Wahab Riaz as Pakistan broke up the all left-arm pace attack they had deployed for the first two Tests of this four-match contest following England�s 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford.Sohail made the most of his chance after Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq won the toss and fielded on a gloomy morning, with some moisture still in the pitch after overnight rain.An unconvincing Hales (17) fell when he was caught behind after edging a good-length Sohail ball.Root had made a Test-best 254 at Old Trafford in a match where he and century-maker Alastair Cook, the England captain scored 506 runs between them for just twice out. Misbah had described the pair as the ""pillars"" of an otherwise fragile-looking England top order.Pakistan knocked down the first of those pillars when Root, playing one of his favourite back-foot forcing shots, edged Sohail and was held by sometimes fallible slip fielder Mohammad Hafeez for just three.Sohail had taken two wickets for eight runs in nine balls and England were 48 for two.Left-handed opener Cook, carrying on from where he left off in Manchester, made 45 in 52 balls, including eight fours. But Rahat Ali had him lbw with a full-length ball that struck Cook on the front pad. Cook reviewed, more in hope than expectation, but was duly given out to leave England 75 for three.In seven Tests since England�s nailbiting two-run win over Australia in 2005 no team batting first had won a Test at Edgbaston.Vince, yet to make a fifty in his seven previous Test innings, again flirted with danger outside off stump before guiding England to 100 for three at lunch.On 39, an uncertain defensive prod outside off stump against Sohail saw Vince edge low to second slip Younis Khan.Bairstow had rescued England from many a dire position in recent Tests. But he made just 12 before, trying to cut a sharply bouncing Sohail delivery, he was caught behind by opposing wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Sohail had taken two for six in 10 balls, with England now 158 for five.",8/3/2016,,

But openers Alastair Cook and Alex Hales both went early on Saturday as Pakistan took two wickets for no runs in nine balls.Joe Root (62) and James Vince (42) stopped the rot during a painstaking stand of 95.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah struck either side of tea to dismiss Root and Gary Ballance. But the pair�s Yorkshire colleague Bairstow, in at 257 for four, scored briskly and he received excellent support from Ali as they overpowered a tiring Pakistan attack featuring just four frontline bowlers.England scored 152 runs in Saturday�s final session, after managing 142 runs in the first two sessions combined.Play resumed Saturday with England captain Cook 64 not out and Hales 50 not out after they had erased a first-innings deficit of 103 with their maiden century stand in 18 innings as a Test-match opening pair. But Pakistan soon removed both batsmen.Left-hander Cook (66) pushed out to first-innings five-wicket hero Sohail Khan and a diving Shah held an excellent catch at point.Mohammad Amir then turned 126 for one into 126 for two when Hales (54) edged a seaming delivery from the left-arm quick and Younis Khan held a difficult low chance at second slip.Root, who made a Test-best 254 in England�s 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford, struck two superb fours off Sohail -- a back-foot force followed by a cover-drive.Root, however, had a reprieve on 25 when he edged Rahat Ali only for Mohammad Hafeez to drop the low, two-handed, chance at first slip.It was tough on left-arm paceman Rahat, who bowled superbly in reeling off five straight maidens in a spell of seven overs for just seven runs.After lunch, Root pulled Shah for a boundary that saw him to a 108-ball fifty.<br/> But Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, had his revenge when Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42. But he too fell in familiar fashion when, flirting outside off stump against the new ball, he wastefully guided Amir to second slip Younis.England, 262 for four at tea, lost Ballance (28) on 285 when Shah, bowling round the wicket, had the left-hander well caught by leg slip Asad Shafiq off a genuine glance. But Ali cover-drove Shah for four and, two balls later, he whipped him for another four wide of mid-on.Bairstow clipped Sohail off his pads and swept Shah for two well-struck fours on his way to a 69-ball fifty. Left-hander Ali, to chants of �Moeen, Moeen Ali� from a crowd of more than 15,500, followed Bairstow to the landmark in 64 balls.�",8/6/2016,,

It�s not a secret that this government has failed. That is why you are seeing all these people gathered here are concerned about how things are.""Pastor Evan Mawarire who called for a national strike last month which shut down businesses and schools and paralysed the public transport system was behind the protest, according to a video he posted on Facebook.Police had earlier arrested at least 10 members of the pressure group Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) who staged a protest outside the venue of the Test match calling on Mugabe to fix the ailing economy or step down.""Mugabe Must Go"" one placard read, and another protestor called for resistance to a government plan to introduce token bank notes to ease cash shortages. The demonstration was dispersed by mounted police.After 36 years of Mugabe�s authoritarian rule, Zimbabwe has seen a rise in opposition protests fuelled by internet activism using the hashtag ""ThisFlag"" - a reference to wearing the national flag in public.On Wednesday hundreds of protestors held a march in the capital calling on 92-year-old Mugabe to step down over worsening economic troubles which have seen banks running short of cash and the government failing to pay its workers on time.Three weeks ago, Zimbabwe�s independence war veterans, who had been loyal allies of Mugabe, issued a strongly-worded statement calling on him to step down.Despite his advanced age, the president has fought back, vowing to crack down on leaders of the protests.The ruling party on Thursday expelled four war veterans suspected to be behind the criticism.�",8/6/2016,,

I thought he bowled exceptionally well in the first innings but the key is you�ve got to do it both innings.""The coach added: ""Mohammad Amir bowled outstandingly well tonight (Friday). Yasir did the same. We just need a little bit of support for those two.""Pakistan�s top-order have struggled in England.But Thursday saw a second-wicket stand of 181 between Azhar Ali, whose 139 was his first Test century outside of Asia, and Sami Aslam (82).Left-handed opener Aslam�s highest Test score was particularly impressive as it came in the 20-year-old�s first innings of this series and just his third match at this level.""That was real Test batting from Sami and Azhar,"" said Arthur.<br/>""The lessons we�ve learnt from the tour, they were all put into place. They left well, they made England bowl at them.""Arthur added: ""Sami played outstandingly well for a young boy. He hasn�t had many opportunities this tour, but he�s worked so hard in the nets, he�s trained the house down.""<br/>The Pakistan coach regretted his side ""lack an all-rounder -- we lack a Chris Woakes"" after the paceman led England�s attack with three for 79 in 30 overs on his Warwickshire home ground.Woakes then put his feet up while Cook and Hales kept Pakistan at bay.<br/>""Going into that innings, we were behind the eight ball -- 100 runs behind in any game is quite a decent margin,"" said Woakes.""For them to cancel that deficit out the way they have, looking pretty solid and not like giving any chances, was crucial.""",8/6/2016,,

But it came as Brazil battles a crippling recession, double-digit unemployment and rising crime and Temer fought off political turmoil.As the clock ticked down to the start of the ceremony, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to vent their fury at Brazil�s rulers and the multi-billion-dollar cost of the Games.Waving signs reading ""No to the Olympics!"", about 3,000 people gathered outside the luxury Copacabana Palace Hotel where many Olympic athletes are staying.Brazil has spent more than $10 billion on new infrastructure and preparing for the Games at a time of economic crisis.The billions lavished on the Games has angered many Brazilians as the country grapples with a tanking economy and mass social problems.""This party wasn�t done for the people. The Games don�t come close to the reality lived by the poor. So I�m protesting against the lack of finances for our schools and for the way our salaries are only paid in instalments,"" said teacher Guilherme Moreira Dias, 38.The ceremony launches 17 days of sporting drama led by a cast of elite athletes including sprint king Usain Bolt and swimming superstar Phelps which wraps up on August 21.As well as the economic problems, Brazil is also in the grip of a political crisis which led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. She refused to attend the ceremony, leaving Temer in her place with a hostile reception from the crowd predicted.At most Games the lighting of the flame is a highlight.And the secret of the Rio flame returned ahead of the ceremony when Brazilian football great Pele, 75, said he could not carry the torch because of poor health.A vast security blanket of 85,000 military and police -- twice the number on duty at the 2012 London Games -- will be draped over the city to ward off the threat of street crime and terror attacks.That has not been able to offer total protection, with a spate of thefts from the Olympic Athletes village. The Danish, Chinese and Australian delegations have all reported items stolen. Journalists� cameras and laptops have also been targeted for thefts.Anticipation for the sporting battles has been eclipsed by fallout from the Russian doping scandal that has divided the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency.The IOC�s decision not to impose a blanket ban on Russia over revelations of a state-sponsored doping program opened the door to legal turmoil. That left the precise make-up of the Russian team in limbo. On Thursday, the IOC confirmed the Russian team would be made up of 271 athletes, with 118 eliminated because of the drug scandal.The first gold medal should be awarded on Saturday in shooting.All eyes will be on American swimming star Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, when he returns to the pool in the first week.Track and field will see Jamaican star Bolt aim to defend his 100m, 200m and 4x100m crowns by clinching all three for the third straight Games.Gymnastics, meanwhile, could see the world find a new darling with America�s teenage star Simone Biles while new sports making their debut in Rio will include seven-a-side rugby and golf.",8/6/2016,,
