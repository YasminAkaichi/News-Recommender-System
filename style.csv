"The coronavirus outbreak has turned many of us into nervous germophobes, seeking to protect ourselves from infection by washing our hands methodically and frequently, avoiding unnecessary contact with so called high-touch surfaces and methodically sanitizing packages, our homes and our bodies.Courtenay Patlin, a 28-year-old in Los Angeles, is trying to find balance between appropriate caution and overreaction. Several weeks ago, before the California shelter-in-place order, Ms. Patlin decided to mostly stay indoors.She used to clean her apartment and her hands with pure bleach and cleaning solutions until the skin on her fingers started to peel off, which she would take as a sign that she was cleaning the proper amount.In recent years, she said, she had managed what is known as “contamination O.C.D.” with medication and therapy. But these days, Ms. Patlin has felt her O.C.D. take reign again.Those who have successfully gone through treatment to overcome or manage a contamination obsession and sanitizing compulsion are working hard to cope.The residential treatment was followed by a monthlong step-down recovery program, during which she lived in an apartment with other O.C.D. patients.Exposure and response prevention therapy is the most effective treatment, experts say. It systematically tests a patient’s worries that something will harm them by exposing them in a prolonged, repetitive and intensifying system to things that they fear.Dr. Riemann said he and other professionals in this field have been conferring daily about ways to dilute exposure therapy so that it conforms to the public health coronavirus standards while still offering therapeutic value.A silver lining for some people diagnosed with O.C.D. is that the pandemic is showing them how far they have come.Mr. Blitt, who has always relied on humor to help him cope — as a kid he once dressed as a bottle of Purell for Halloween — is still finding ways to laugh.","April 3, 2020, 5:00 a.m. ET",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/03/style/ocd-coronavirus-challenges.html,"For Those With O.C.D., a Threat That Is Both Heightened and Familiar",Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/fashion/02VIRUS-OCD1/merlin_171098970_fc5f97ac-956f-4837-aa5d-3903f88ddfa8-jumbo.jpg
"Earlier this month, Eric Richard was in Bali, Indonesia, enjoying the tropical weather and carefree life of a retiree. Last summer, at 29, Mr. Richard had quit his job as a corporate operations manager to become a “digital nomad.”Now the coronavirus has thrashed several nation’s economies, from Japan to Germany. The U.S. stock market had its steepest drop ever in March. Naturally, some are predicting the decline or end of the FIRE lifestyle.But the couple, who wrote a FIRE how-to guide, “Quit Like a Millionaire,” consider themselves “some of the most pessimistic people in this space,” Ms. Shen said. That caution, along with their engineer training to create multiple backup plans, has served them well.That unfortunate circumstance is where Mr. Richard finds himself. Not only did he retire less than a year ago, but he also practices “lean FIRE” — generally defined as a net worth of between $500,000 and $1 million (as opposed to the $1 million and greater many accumulate before “firing”).Ms. Shen and Mr. Leung are similarly sanguine about their continued future as millennial retirees, though they are making lifestyle adjustments. “Going forward, we are going to live on $40,000 a year, and maybe less,” Ms. Shen said. “Because I’m finding all kinds of deals.”","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/style/fire-movement-stock-market-coronavirus.html,They All Retired Before They Hit 40.

"In recent weeks, as the coronavirus has tightened restrictions on public and private life, Americans have been hoarding toilet paper, their shopping carts piled high, as supplies were quickly depleted: the shelves, and sometimes whole aisles, bare.I grew up with an Iranian Muslim mother, who had passed along the ritual of washing after every bowel movement. What began as a source of shame (“Why do you keep watering cans next to all your toilets?” my friends would ask when they came to our house) would eventually become a badge of honor. My bathroom hygiene was immaculate. I would never know skid marks, except as something grotesque and unfathomable, like fascism.Depictions of bidets in popular culture often focus on luxury models. In a 2016 episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” for example, Kris and Kylie Jenner visit the West Hollywood gallery of Toto, the Japanese brand famed for its toilets that offer, among other features, a “rear wash” nozzle that jerks up and down while emitting a thin stream of water like a precision strike missile.A 2017 “Broad City” episode shows Ilana Glazer’s character romanced by the rhythmic pulse of her affluent Upper East Side employer’s bidet, which offers settings like “staccato” and “water slide.”When obstructions occur in the wastewater treatment plant in Charleston, S.C., the city hires divers to submerge through 13 stories of sewage, where they fill a dive cage with as many wipes as they can find before the obstruction is unearthed.","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/style/toilet-paper-shortage-bidet-coronavirus-wipes.html,Is It Time for Americans to Embrace the Bidet?,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/fashion/01virus-bidet-do-not-edit-for-print-cinemagraph-still/01virus-bidet-do-not-edit-for-print-cinemagraph-still-videoLarge.jpg
"You might not know Batsheva Hay, Christopher John Rogers and Carly Cushnie. They are emerging independent designers based in New York with relatively small namesake companies.Of the 477 members of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), almost 40 percent, by far the largest number, is made up of brands that were worth under $1 million last year. The next largest percentage, 22 percent, are brands that earned under $5 million.“I’m getting dozens of calls a day,” he said. “That’s what scares them.”Mr. Rogers, 26, founded his company a year after graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2016. He has a signature style that combines Joan Crawford and the Cotton Club, heavy on lavish fabrics and saturated jewel tones. His clothes have been worn by Tracee Ellis Ross and Rihanna.“If I hadn’t won the fund, I don’t know what we would be doing now,” he said in a call from his boyfriend’s apartment in Bushwick in Brooklyn, where he is holed up, miles away from his SoHo studio (the one he moved into in January) making mood boards in his bedroom.Mr. Rogers said:Ms. Hay, 39, founded Batsheva in 2016 after a stint as a lawyer. She was at the forefront of the recent trend toward post-male-gaze prairie dress, an aesthetic that could perhaps be best described as ironic Amish. The line is now sold in about 50 stores around the world.“I’ve been looking at oven mitts, aprons, tea towels — things we can make using the fabrics we have that people might actually want now,” she said.Ms. Cushnie, 36, is British, attended Parsons and founded her company 12 years ago with a fellow student as Cushnie et Ochs. Two years ago, she restructured and went out on her own. Some 100 stores now carry her trademark blend of architectural body-conscious urbanity. She is working at home in Bed-Stuy, eight months pregnant, juggling her one-year-old and her 12 employees.Right now we would normally be shipping prefall, but many retailers don’t want it until June or July, or even later. Lots of retailers are calling to make cuts or cancel fall entirely because they think they will use prefall as fall. I’d say our total fall orders have been reduced by half. We’re missing a quarter’s worth of money. Payroll protection doesn’t pay for that.","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/fashion/coronavirus-fashion-bankruptcy.html,Will We Lose a Generation of Designers?,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/fashion/01DESIGNERS-IN-CRISIS-batsheva-hay-1/01DESIGNERS-IN-CRISIS-batsheva-hay-1-videoLarge-v2.jpg
"A tutorial on how to make your own fabric face mask from common household materials.Guidance on whether to wear a face mask has been evolving. But the Trump administration is expected to announce this week that all Americans should wear cloth masks if they go out in public, based on a forthcoming recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention amid new concerns that the coronavirus is spread by infected people who have no symptoms.You will need:Choose your piece of cotton fabric, prewash it on the warmest setting and dry it on high heat. (Tea towels are better to use than T-shirts or linens, according to the Stanford Anesthesia Informatics and Media Lab.)Now it’s on to the fabric ties.Cut 4 thin pieces of material, about 18” long and ¾” wide. Fold each piece of fabric twice lengthwise, then once more to tuck the rough edges inside. Sew a straight line along the middle. This will prevent the fabric ties from having frayed edges.Take one of your rectangular fabric layers. With the “right side” (or the outer-facing side, where the pattern might be) facing you, pin down the 4 fabric ties, one piece per corner. Make sure that the ties are gathered in the center of the fabric layer before advancing to the next step.PUTTING IT TOGETHERTake the second layer of fabric and line it up with the first. The “right sides” (or patterned sides) of the fabric should be facing each other, sandwiching the fabric ties or elastics. Secure the fabric sandwich together with pins.Eyeball a midway point. From the middle, sew a straight line across the mask, about ¼” above the bottom edge of the fabric, toward the bottom left-hand corner. Remove any pins as you sew past them.Make sure that the elastic or fabric ties are secured in the corners, sandwiched by your two layers of fabric, as you sew over their ends. You want to make sure your needle goes through the three pieces: the top layer, the end of the fabric tie, and the bottom layer. Add a couple stitches forward and backward (in both directions) to secure your ties in place.Stitch all around the perimeter of the fabric layers, repeating the forward and backward motion at each corner to secure all the elastic ends or fabric ties.Turn your project right-side out from the little 1 ½” gap. Your fabric ties or elastics should now stick out, like little legs.Make three staggered pleats lengthwise on the mask, as if folding a paper fan. This helps the mask conform to the wearer’s face. Secure each pleat with pins.With your pleats held in place by pins, stitch around the perimeter of the mask, ¼” away from the edge of the seam. This is called a top stitch. Take care when stitching over the pleats as the fabric may be quite thick.","March 31, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//article/how-to-make-face-mask-coronavirus.html,How to Sew a Face Mask,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/31/fashion/31virus-diymasks-topper3/31virus-diymasks-topper3-videoLarge-v2.jpg
"As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the United States, many influencers are using their platforms to educate their followers about symptoms and testing, and to encourage them to stay inside.On March 26, just eight days after she tested positive for Covid-19, the fashion influencer Arielle Charnas alerted her 1.3 million followers that she would be leaving her Manhattan apartment with her husband and daughters and heading to a house in the Hamptons. The next day she posted a photo of herself and her daughter strolling around the neighborhood. When people got angry, she turned off the comments on her posts.This week, the food blogger Ali Maffucci also left the New York metropolitan area for Florida with her family. She said that none of them are symptomatic, but she believes that people in her building may be sick.All three women stressed that, upon reaching their destinations, they would take precautions to avoid the spread of disease. Ms. Charnas said in a statement through her publicist that she is following “doctor’s recommendations to a tee” and taking “every precaution to ensure we did not and will not come into contact, six feet apart or otherwise, with any other individual for the foreseeable future.”“You are literally an influencer, and this will influence people to make similar (irresponsible and selfish) choices,” a commenter wrote on Ms. Maffucci’s post. Ms. Davis did not respond to a request for comment.“We all make mistakes,” Ms. Charnas said in an email statement, “including me, especially when a crisis such as this is developing so quickly. My family and I apologize to those we have offended for not appearing to be taking this crisis seriously, but I am absolutely committed to making informed, responsible decisions for my family and community.”The primary issue many medical experts take issue with, however, is not the influencers’ decision to leave the city against public health guidelines, but that they’re promoting this message to potentially millions of people.","April 2, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/02/style/influencers-leave-new-york-coronavirus.html,Flight of the Influencers,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/fashion/01VIRUS-INFLUENCERS-catskills/merlin_171198093_2359fa2f-a13d-4183-b41f-7dbf1f21f91c-videoLarge.jpg
"When Dave Kyu, 34, an arts administrator in Philadelphia, realized that he would be working from home for the foreseeable future, he began to fantasize about the projects he could now complete around the house.But in the midst of a global pandemic that has upended nearly every facet of modern life, people are finding it harder and harder to get things done.Anne Helen Petersen, a journalist and the author of the forthcoming book “Can’t Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation,” seconded his assertion. “We’re so used to making every moment of ours productive in some capacity,” she said. “Like, I’m on a walk, I should listen to this information podcast that makes me more informed or a better person.”“For a lot of Americans, everyone’s job is at stake right now whether you thought you were upper middle class, middle or working class, everyone’s livelihood is at stake,” she said. Right now she is focusing on not allowing her mind to “drift to a place of fear, concern, panic or stress,” she said, and instead encouraging herself to “keep the faith and remain grateful.”","April 1, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/04/01/style/productivity-coronavirus.html,Stop Trying to Be Productive,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/fashion/01VIRUS-PRODUCTIVITY-art/01VIRUS-PRODUCTIVITY-art-videoLarge.jpg
"Many people spend their nights now tossing and turning, struggling to unglue from the constant scroll of coronavirus news updates.Set yourself up for success by doing the little things: use blackout curtains if you’re sleeping while it’s bright, ditto to earplugs or a sleep mask (Wirecutter, a company owned by The New York Times that judges products, recommends this sleep mask, but even a light pillow or T-shirt works in a pinch).“It may be tempting to stay up late binge-watching your favorite shows because you don’t have to go to work in the morning, but it is more important than ever to prioritize your sleep,” said Kristen L. Knutson, an associate professor at Northwestern University’s Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine.This is a must, not only because it makes you tired and ready for bed. Exercising also helps with something else we’re all dealing with, whether we’re sick or well: anxious, nervous energy. Dr. Kirsch said, “This can be as simple as a neighborhood walk or doing an exercise video at home.” (If you do go on a walk, stay six feet away from other people.)Also, if you are suffering from anxiety, speak to a clinic or a doctor or a mental health professional, or at least try to get one of those. Debilitating anxiety is a medical condition.And while you’re taking care of your body, take care of your space. If possible, use HEPA filter air cleaners for your bedroom, wash your sheets twice a week, and give your home, particularly your bedroom, a nightly clean. Here is a guide on how to clean your home for coronavirus. You’re probably spending more time than ever there; this can promote peace of mind and might lower anxiety.The science is simple: a good night’s sleep supports the release and production of cytokine, a protein that helps the immune system quickly respond to antigens — foreign substances which cause the body’s immune response to kick in — according to Dr. Medalie.","March 25, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/03/25/style/self-care/sleep-tips-benefits-coronavirus.html,How to Get More Sleep Tonight,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/fashion/20Sleep-1/20Sleep-1-videoLarge.jpg
"They are scrounging for fabric, cutting it up, stitching it together. They are repurposing drapes, dresses, bra straps, shower curtains, even coffee filters. They are building supply chains, organizing workers, managing distribution networks.In the meantime, some of the void is being filled by legions of sewers, called to duty in a matter of days via social media and word of mouth, their skills no longer taken for granted or dismissed as a mere hobby. They are working in living rooms, at kitchen tables and inside shuttered storefronts. They are making masks for America, much as a previous generation manufactured ammunition and tended “victory gardens” during World War II.“Are they effective like an N95? No,” she said. “We’re not claiming they are. If we had all the N95s in the world, it would be wonderful. But there’s a shortage right now.”“We want to put masks on everybody,” said Bettina D’Ascoli. She runs a sewing studio in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., that offers sewing classes to children and adults. The shop is closed now, and Ms. D’Ascoli has parked herself on a metal stool at a sturdy wooden worktable inside. Using the studio’s supply of prewashed quilting cotton, she has made about 50 masks so far. They have bright colors and vivid patterns: Blue with red polka dots. Tiny fish. Jelly beans.“They need anything they can get, and that’s happening all over our country,” Ms. Lavender said.A man from a nearby funeral home recently went into Treadle Yard Goods and dropped off his business card.In Philadelphia, Nan Ides had plenty of fabric. A recent retiree, she had plenty of time, too.

"Under normal circumstances, Nicole Mereshensky works out about five times a week at various indoor cycling and high intensity interval training studios around Manhattan.When she goes to one-hour classes at Barry’s Bootcamp, where the protocol is four 15-minute intervals of treadmill running and floor weight exercises, she brings a spray bottle of sanitizer and four pairs of latex gloves.Vando Cabral, 35, owns Punch Force Fitness, a boxing fitness studio in Manhattan, with his brother. “I haven’t seen too much of a slowdown,” said Mr. Cabral, who is buying a lot of cleaning supplies. “And with the schools closing, kids have jumped in and are taking classes. But of course we are all worried and that’s why we need to keep at it, washing hands and keeping things as clean as possible.”Angie Beis, 39, is a physical therapist and personal trainer hired by individuals for one-on-one sessions at their homes, and by corporations who bring her to their offices to give group training to employees.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Audium, a 49-seat theater that is enclosed by 176 speakers, is a vestige of oddball experimentation in a rapidly gentrifying city. Stan Shaff, 91, who began his experiment six decades ago, just a few years before the Summer of Love, describes it as a “sound sculpture.” Stan, who was once the sole performer to run the theater’s tiny “cockpit,” has largely handed the reins over to David. “I’m tempted to say he started in the womb,” said Stan, who recorded sonar checkups with his pregnant wife and inserted the sound of David’s toddler chatter into his musical compositions.David hopes to tap into the hunger for immersive experiences to expand Audium’s offerings and grow its community beyond a core group of audiophiles. He plans to collaborate with artists from multiple disciplines, and is digitizing the space’s analog technology, with the help of Paul Barton, a nuclear engineer from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It’s “like a speakeasy,” said Logan Daniel, a sound artist who has experienced the performance about half a dozen times since the 1990s.","March 13, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/03/13/style/self-care/sound-san-francisco-audium.html,San Francisco’s Arty Past Still Makes Some Noise,Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/fashion/00AUDIUMa/00AUDIUMa-videoLarge-v2.jpg
"In the dense thicket of the internet lies a verdant patch of grass where dappled sunbeams peek through the leaves, resting fawns doze about, a troop of woodland mushrooms grows underfoot, and a brook faintly burbles in the distance. Freshly baked scones are just emerging from the oven in a thatch roof country cottage bordering the woods, while linen-scented laundry dries peacefully on a clothesline in the yard.It’s a Holly Hobbie illustration come to life, consisting of a coterie of young people, mostly in their teens and early 20s, who congregate online to swap bread baking recipes and photos of their foraged mushroom hauls, stare at pictures of farm animals and otherwise partake in an aspirational form of nostalgia that praises the benefits of living a slow life in which nothing much happens at all.Ms. Kellum discovered cottagecore after graduating high school in 2019, when she wasn’t quite sure which direction her life would take. “The concept of living a simple, slow life made me happy,” she said. “It helped me remember that living in constant stress just to keep up didn’t have to be my default state.”Some cottagecore participants are self-identified lesbians outspoken in their support for trans rights. Nancee Craft (her real name), a 19-year-old from South Salem, Ohio, runs the Instagram account @cottagecore_faerie, which proclaims in the bio, “the fae says trans rights.”“People want to be closer to nature,” said Kai Chow, a creative director at the Doneger Group, a design consulting agency in New York City. “The biggest trend in interior design is bringing the outdoors indoors.”Mx. Cavar, who is nonbinary, became disillusioned by the proliferation of bugs, dung and the mortifying experience of having a goat spread its excrement “not only into the ridges on the bottom of my Birkenstocks,” as they wrote in a blog post called “Et Tu, Cottagecore?” “but also onto my thighs and the groin area of my shorts.”SoraBlu splits her time between a canvas bell tent and a 24-foot R.V. on five acres in Long Beach Peninsula, Wash., and has become an unwitting cottagecore idol thanks to TikTok dispatches from her seemingly charmed existence in the woods. (When Ms. Blu posted her cottagecore check video, there were only four videos using the same audio; now there are almost 100.) “I get multiple messages and emails from young women, almost daily,” she said. “And the most popular question is: how?”Betsy Hinze, 28, is an artist and writer behind the blog The Wondersmith, who creates enchanted recipes for moss-covered cakes and savory pies that resemble British folklore’s the Green Man. “I spent a lot of time in my early 20s looking for magic, and then I had this epiphany where I was like, I can just make it,” she said. “I try to capture these moments spent in nature that feel really wholesome and soothing and welcoming to me.”Ms. Hinze suffers from a chronic illness, which makes holding down a regular job impossible. She supports herself by selling barnacle-themed ceramics, and also earn money through Patreon, where monthly donations from fans help cover the expenses of “wonder based events,” like hosting foraged dinner parties to strangers who stumble across an invitation in the woods.","March 10, 2020",https://www.nytimes.com//2020/03/10/style/cottagecore.html,"Escape Into Cottagecore, Calming Ethos for Our Febrile Moment",Style,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/12/fashion/09COTTAGECORE2/09COTTAGECORE2-videoLarge-v2.jpg
